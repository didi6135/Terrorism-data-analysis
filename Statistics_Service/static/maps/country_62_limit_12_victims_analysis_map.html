Although it was initially suspected that the Taliban carried out this attack, which they adamantly denied, a Taliban splinter group named Jaysh al-Muslimin (Army of the Muslims), led by Mullah Sayed Mohammad, claimed responsibility and seven members of said group were arrested in connection with this attack along with two other suicide attacks in Kandahar.<br><b>Location Name:</b> Afghanistan<br><b>Average Injured:</b> 100<br><b>Average Killed:</b> 101<br><b>Score:</b> 302</div>`)[0];
