A Swissair DC-8 en route from Zurich , and a TWA 707 en route from Frankfurt were flown to Dawson Field, a landing strip in the Jordanian desert described by the hijackers as the Revolution Airport.A fourth hijacking of an El Al Israel Airlines plane en route to London from Amsterdam was foiled when a security guard aboard the plane killed one of the hijackers and wounded another.  The dead hijacker was Patrick Arguello, a member of the FSLN, a leftist guerrilla movement in Nicaragua.  The wounded hijacker was Leila Khaled, who had participated in the hijacking of a TWA 707 to Syria on August 29, 1969.  Miss Khaled was arrested in London but later released to gain release of the hostages in Jordan.The PFLP announced that the hijackings were in retaliation for American support of Israel and the U.S.  peace initiatives in the Middle East.  The hijackers demanded the release of Arab guerrillas imprisoned in Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and West Germany.  West Germany at first agreed to release the prisoners, but later reversed its position in favor of a joint international effort to free the passengers.On September 9, the PFLP hijacked a BOAC VC-10 from Bombay, India and also had it flown to Dawson Field in Jordan, bringing the total number of hostages held in the desert to 300.  Negotiations to free them were complicated by the outbreak of fighting between Jordanian troops and Palestinian guerrillas.  On September 12, the remaining passengers (women and children had been removed earlier) were evacuated and the three planes were blown up.  Most of the passengers were soon released, but the PFLP continued to hold 58 hostages in order to exert pressure on the European governments.  The hostages were released on September 25, 26, and 29.  On September 29, the Swiss government announced that the British, Swiss and West German governments would free seven Arab guerrillas when the last six hostages, who were US citizens, had left Jordan.  The seven prisoners were relased and flown to Cairo on September 30.Twenty-five persons who were held hostage for 22 days reached a combined $370,000 out-of-court settlement with TWA whose 707 jet was one of the hijacked planes.  Awards in the settlement ranged from $17,500 for a single person to a combined $80,000 for a six-member family.  The attorney for the plaintiffs said, It is one of the first cases where an airline accepted responsibility for recovery for mental anguish (suffered by passengers) in hijacking cases."

A TWA 707 flight enroute from Frankfurt was hijacked to Dawson Field, a landing strip at Zerya in Jordan (described by the hijackers as the Revolution Airport.  A Pan American World Airways 747 was first ordered flown to Beirut, then to Cairo, where it was blown up a few minutes after the passengers and crew were evacuated.  A Swissair DC-8 en route from Zurich was also hijacked to Dawson Field. A fourth hijacking of an El Al Israel Airlines plane en route to London from Amsterdam was foiled when a security guard aboard the plane killed one of the hijackers and wounded another.  The dead hijacker was Patrick Arguello, a member of the FSLN, a leftist guerrilla movement in Nicaragua.  The wounded hijacker was Leila Khaled, who had participated in the hijacking of a TWA 707 to Syria on August 29, 1969.  Miss Khaled was arrested in London but later released to gain release of the hostages in Jordan.The PFLP announced that the hijackings were in retaliation for American support of Israel and the U.S.  peace initiatives in the Middle East.  The hijackers demanded the release of Arab guerrillas imprisoned in Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and West Germany.  West Germany at first agreed to release the prisoners, but later reversed its position in favor of a joint international effort to free the passengers.On September 9, the PFLP hijacked a BOAC VC-10 from Bombay, India and also had it flown to Dawson Field in Jordan, bringing the total number of hostages held in the desert to 300.  Negotiations to free them were complicated by the outbreak of fighting between Jordanian troops and Palestinian guerrillas.  On September 12, the remaining passengers (women and children had been removed earlier) were evacuated and the three planes were blown up.  Most of the passengers were soon released, but the PFLP continued to hold 58 hostages in order to exert pressure on the European  governments.  The hostages were released on September 25, 26, and 29.  One September 29, the Swiss government announced that the British, Swiss and West German governments would free seven Arab guerrillas when the last six hostages, who were US citizens, had left Jordan.  The seven prisoners were released and flown to Cairo on September 30.Twenty-five persons who were held hostage for 22 days reached a combined $370,000 out-of-court settlement with TWA whose 707 jet was one of the planes hijacked.  Awards in the settlement ranged from $17,500 for a single person to a combined $80,000 for a six-member family.  The attorney for the plaintiffs said, It is one of the first cases where an airline accepted responsibility for recovery for mental anguish (suffered by passengers) in hijacking cases."

Members of the Quebec Liberation Front (FLQ) kidnapped James R. Cross, British trade commissioner in Quebec Province, and demanded as ransom the release of 13 imprisoned FLQ members and their flight to Algeria or Cuba, the publication of the FLQ manifesto, the payment of $500,000 in gold, the publication of the name of the informant whose tip had led police to raid an FLQ hideout in June, and the reinstatement of certain post office workers who had lost their jobs.  The Canadian government rejected the demands but attempted (unsuccessfully) to communicate with the kidnappers.FLQ members kidnapped Pierre LaPorte, minister of labor in the Quebec government.  The kidnappers warned that they would kill LaPorte if the demands made by Cross's kidnappers were not met.  The government again rejected the demands, but offered the kidnappers a safe conduct out of the country if the two hostages were released unharmed.  On October 16, the federal government of Canada invoked emergency powers which authorized police and troops to conduct searches and make arrests without warrants.  On October 18, LaPorte's body was found in the trunk of a car.  In a massive hunt for the kidnappers, more than 500 suspected members and sympathizers of the FLQ were arrested.  Three were later convicted.On December 3, James Cross's kidnappers dropped all of their previous demands and released him unharmed in return for safe conduct to Cuba. On December 28, 1971, LaPorte's kidnappers were arrested.  They were subsequently tried, found guilty, and sentenced to life imprisonment. In December 1978, a French-Canadian couple ended their self-exile in France to face trial in Montreal for the kidnapping of Cross.  They refused to plead to the charges in a preliminary hearing.  The judge entered a plea of not guilty on their behalf.  On August 7, 1979, Jacques and Louise Cossette-Trudel received two-year jail sentences for the kidnapping.  Jacques Lanctot, brother of Louise Cossette-Trudel, was given a longer sentence because he refused to express regret for his actions when he pleaded guilty.On June 9, 1982, Yves Langlois, the last of the five Quebec separatist guerrillas wanted for the kidnapping of James Cross, returned home to Montreal from exile in France.  He pleaded guilty to forcible detention, extortion and conspiracy.  In September 1982, Langlois was sentenced to one day less than two years and was ordered to do 150 hours of community work after his release."

Three Japanese gunmen attacked passengers at Tel Aviv's Lod Airport with machine guns and hand grenades, killing 25 people and wounding 76.  The gunmen were members of the URA of Japan who had been recruited by the PFLP for the assault.  They had arrived at Lod Airport on an Air France flight from Paris, picked up their suitcases which contained the weapons, and opened fire on the crowd.  One terrorist was killed by gunfire from the other two, a second was killed by his own grenade, and the third was captured.  The PFLP claimed credit for the attack, saying that the three terrorists belonged to the Squad of the Martyr Patrick Arguello.  Arguello was killed in a l970 hijacking attempt over London (see September 6, 1970 incident).  The PFLP also said that the killings were in retaliation for the shooting of two Arab guerrillas in a hijacking three weeks before, on May 8.According to the PFLP, the three Japanese gunmen had been instructed not to fire on the Air France passengers, but to wait ten minutes for an arriving El Al Israel Airlines flight in order to ensure that 90 to 95 percent of the victims would be Israelis or people with direct loyalties to Israel.  The PFLP said, however, that in any case it did not regard tourists visiting Israel as innocent civilians:  The mere choice of our occupied territory as a place for tourism is in itself a bias in favor of the enemy. The surviving gunman said that the URA had concluded the alliance with the PFLP as a means of thrusting itself on the world stage.Kozo Okamoto was sentenced to life in prison for the attack.

A fifth hijacker--a woman reported to be a Latin American carrying a Peruvian passport--was killed shortly after the takeover, when a hand grenade she was holding accidentally exploded.  A Japanese purser was injured in the blast.  The three Arabs identified themselves as members of Palestinian groups and the Japanese hijacker was identified as a member of the Japanese Red Army [URA] acting for the people of Palestine. All major Palestinian guerrilla organizations denounced the hijacking and disclaimed any responsibility for it.The hijackers acted as if they were confused, lending credence to the belief that the woman who had been killed was the leader and the others had not been fully briefed on their mission, which was to gain the release of URA members held in Japan and the recovery of the $6 million in compensation money that Japan paid to the victims of the Lod Airport attack (see May 31, 1972, incident).  It was reported in Lebanon that the hijackers also demanded $5 million in ransom.The hijackers ordered the plane flown to Lebanon, but Lebanese authorities refused them permission to land, as did authorities at Bahrain, their second choice.  They finally landed in Dubai. Officials of Japan Air Lines arrived there to negotiate, but the hijackers rejected any negotiations and flew on to Damascus, then to Benghazi in Libya, where the hijackers released the passengers and destroyed the aircraft with explosives.  A statement later issued by the Organization of the Sons of Occupied Territories said that the plane had been destroyed in retaliation for the payment that the Japanese government made to victims of the Lod Airport incident.

The terrorists then seized 35 hostages, but later surrendered to Greek police.There was some confusion as to the affiliation of the two men.  They claimed to be members of the BSO, but an anonymous BSO spokesman denied it.  On August 8, a new group calling itself the Seventh Suicide Squad claimed responsibility for the attack, which it named the Bahr al-Bakr operation after a Cairo suburb where Israeli planes bombed a school in 1970.  All other Palestinian organizations condemned the attack.  Two men, one a Palestinian and the other a Lebanese, were later arrested, tried, and on August 24, 1973, sentenced to death (see below: December 17, 1973 and February 2, 1974 incidents).  These sentences were later commuted to meet the demands of terrorists, calling themselves Moslem International Guerrillas, who had hijacked a Greek freighter.  The two were deported to Libya in 1974.In August 1979, a suspected Arab terrorist who allegedly took part in this incident was arrested in Orange County, California by U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service agents.  Milidos der Garabedian, 32, identified as a native of Jordan, was booked into Los Angeles County Jail on charges he concealed important information when he applied for his visa under another undisclosed name.

A deportation hearing was to be held for Garabedian.Four victims of the terrorist attack were awarded a total of $230,000 to be paid by Trans World Airlines (even though the airline was found to be blameless) to compensate for the death of one passenger and injuries sustained by three others.

IRELAND.  Thomas Niedermayer, a West German industrialist associated with the Grundig Electronics Company, who was also his country's honorary consul, was kidnapped from his home.  The list of suspects was topped by members of the IRA.  Three possible motives for the abduction were:  to obtain the release or transfer to Northern Ireland of two sisters, Dolours and Marion Price, who were imprisoned in England for their part in a car-bomb attack in London in March 1973; to raise ransom money from Grundig; or to frighten off foreign investment.  On September 6, 1979, it was revealed by the Boston Globe that Niedermayer died of a heart attack while being held captive, and before any ransom demand was made.  A former IRA activist, Peter McMullen, revealed the fate of Niedermayer, stating that an IRA strike force wanted Niedermayer for ransom and the release of the Price sisters who were arrested for bombing a London court; when Niedermayer died, the IRA never claimed credit for the abduction because they were too embarrassed.  McMullen himself applied for asylum in the United States in September 1979.  In March 1980, police identified a body found in a garbage dump in Belfast as that of Thomas Niedermayer.On February 16, 1981, John Christopher Bradley, a 42-year-old father of four from Belfast, who had plead guilty to the charge of kidnapping (but not the murder) of Niedermayer, was sentenced to 20 years in jail for his part in the death of the German consul."

Three Arab guerillas from Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine crossed the border from Lebanon into Israel and first attacked a bus carrying Israeli women on their way home from work. The guerillas killed two of the women and wounded six. They then went to MaÕalot village and killed three more people before seizing a school filled with ninety teenagers who were sleeping in the school following a hike. The guerillas occupied the school, although several students and some teachers (twenty in all) managed to escape by jumping from a window. The guerillas demanded the release of twenty terrorists held in Israeli jails and gave officials until 6 pm to comply, or they threatened to kill the children. They also demanded the French and Romanian ambassadors come to secure the deal. Officials complied and the terrorists held in prison were brought to the school for release. However, negotiations broke down at the last minute and Israeli troops stormed the school. In the ensuing gunfight, all three guerillas were killed. At least twenty-six people were killed and seventy wounded, many of them students.  Officials speculate that it is likely the guerillas stumbled upon the students in the school by chance, since they attacked other targets first and since it was the middle of the night, so they would have no reason to believe students were in the school at that time.  The head of the Popular Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, the group claiming responsibility for the attack, Nayef Hawatmeh said that the attack had been aimed against the Middle East peace mission of Henry Kissinger, who had been in the Middle East about two months earlier. Hawatmeh said that Kissinger was suggesting a settlement that would mean Ôsurrender of the Palestinian people.Õ The attack was meant to show Kissinger that the Palestinians rejected any proposal that would hurt the Palestinian cause and would accept only the creation of a Palestinian entity.

A woman in another car rammed the limousine from the rear, and another car drove up to block an escape route from the side.  Lorenz's driver, who jumped from the car, was thrown to the pavement and beaten unconscious.  The female kidnapper was later identified as a fugitive anarchist linked to the Baader-Meinhof band of urban guerrillas.  The Movement of June 2 claimed responsibility for the kidnapping.  The kidnappers freed Peter Lorenz on March 4 after government authorities released five convicted anarchists from West German prisons and flew them, plus a hostage, out of Frankfurt airport for an unknown destination.  A sixth prisoner whose release was requested, refused to join the group.  The prisoners were also given $50,000.  Other demands met by the government included the release of two persons jailed for their role in violent demonstrations in November 1974 after the death of an imprisoned urban guerrilla leader.  Three members of the terrorist band were arrested by authorities six months later.  They were identified as members of the inner circle of the Movement of June 2.  The Lufthansa jet carrying the prisoners and hostage landed March 3 in Aden, Southern Yemen.  After the Aden government granted amnesty to the five, the hostage flew back to West Berlin on March 4 and appeared on television to read a statement from the anarchists.

The original target of the attack was reportedly the Tel Aviv Municipality Youth Center. However, the militants encountered several policemen on their way to the Youth Center. While fleeing the policemen, the militants climbed over an embankment, to the road, and seized the Savoy Hotel, the only lighted building on the street.  The militants took the guests and employees hostage and reportedly demanded a plane to Syria with which to leave with their hostages. They also demanded that the French, Greek, Vatican, or UN ambassador be brought in as a guarantor of the deal and had pamphlets demanding the release of ten prisoners, including the Greek Catholic Archbishop of Jerusalem, Most Rev. Hillarion Capucci, in jail for arms smuggling. They later reduced their demand to safe passage for themselves. On the morning of March 6, Israeli troops stormed the Hotel and ended the stand-off. Eighteen people; eight civilian hostages, three Israeli soldiers, and seven gunmen were killed in the attack. Two of the police officers killed were killed as the militants entered the hotel. At least twelve people; six civilians and six soldiers, were injured in the attack. The attack occurred on the eve of a visit by Secretary of State Henry Kissinger to the Middle East to assist in peace negotiations.  Al-Fatah claimed responsibility for the attack.  They stated that the attack was intended to serve as notice to the Israeli government and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger that there could be no Middle East peace settlement with the Palestinians. Some Fatah militants were saying that the attack originated in Egypt, not Lebanon, though sources reported that this was an attempt to undermine Anwar SadatÕs government (which they were distrustful of) in the upcoming Kissinger meetings. The statement claiming responsibility also reported that the commandos had blown themselves up when they ran out of ammunition. It was unclear if this was true.  On March 6, officials reported that they had captured the ship (which was carrying the two small boats) used to drop off the militants. It is believed the terrorists began their trip in Lebanon."

The kidnappers belonged to an organization called the Front for the Liberation of the French Somali Coast (which was seeking the independence of the French Territory of the Afars and Issas). Ambassador Gueury was taken to a suburban villa which was later surrounded by Somali troops and policemen.  The kidnappers demanded the release of two Front guerrillas imprisoned in France.  They also demanded $100,000 in gold and a plane to fly them across the Gulf of Aden to Southern Yemen.  The French Government accepted the conditions set down by the kidnappers for the safe release of Ambassador Gueury. Southern Yemen unexpectedly refused landing permission to the plane carrying the ambassador and his four captors.  A French plane with the two prisoners and the money aboard was also refused permission to land in Aden.  The French plane landed in Djibouti, the capital of the French territory of the Afars and Issas.  The plane carrying Gueury and his captors landed in North Somalia as diplomatic negotiators sought a new place for the exchange of the prisoners and money for the ambassador.  On March 28, Aden finally agreed to act as the exchange point for the release of Gueury and sanctuary for the liberation front members.  Ambassador Gueury's plane rendezvoused at Aden with the second French plane carrying the two prisoners and the ransom money. Subsequently, Gueury was released unharmed and returned to Paris on the same aircraft that had brought the two prisoners from France.ADDINFO FF:  Gueury was kidnapped as he emerged from a church in Mogadishu, the Somali capital.  The kidnappers had refused to negotiate through the Somali Government.  Italian Ambassador to Somalia Giorgio Giacomelli therefore acted as intermediary between the French government and the captors, who held Gueury in a villa outside the capital.  In several phone calls to his embassy, the French envoy said he was being well-treated.  Somali security agents surrounded the villa, but took no action.

Two charges of dynamite exploded at the construction site of the Fessenheim Nuclear Power reactor station, 45 miles south of Strasbourg, France, on the Rhine River.  No nuclear material was in stock or service at the site.  The self-proclaimed terrorists made no demands, took no hostages, and caused no injuries.  Responsibility for the attack was claimed by an anonymous caller to a local newspaper who warned that three bombs would go off.  He identified himself and his accomplices as members of the Meinhof-Puig-Antich Group. Authorities had no previous knowledge of such a group.  Ulrike Meinhof was a West German anarchist then jailed in Germany, Puig Antich was a Spanish anarchist executed in 1974 by the Franco government for killing a Spanish policeman.  However, because of past protests, it is also possible that the bombs were planted by opponents to nuclear plants, and not by a spin-off of the infamous German terrorists, the Baader-Meinhof group.  Or the perpetrators could have been motivated by both ideological and environmental concerns.  They may have used the name associated with the Baader-Meinhof group as a ploy to gain further publicity and notoriety.A Le Monde correspondent at Strasbourg reported that the perpetrators of the bombing seemed to know the site and understand the features of a nuclear power station.  Two bombs had been placed in the center of the plant next to a nuclear reactor.  The third, which did not explode, was planted nearby in the washroom.  Damage was minor.  A fire, ignited by the explosions, was quickly extinguished by security teams.  A telephone warning, received 70 minutes before the first blast, allowed workers to evacuate the site before the explosions.  No perpetrator has been identified or apprehended.  Plans have been made to build industrial plants and power stations in the Fessenheim area along the Rhine, and citizens of communities on both sides of the river have protested.  However, the local ecological group disclaimed any connection with the incident.  Because the power plant was still in construction and did not yet contain critical  materials, there were no security measures in force to deter the terrorists.  The holiday weekend kept workers at a minimum, and the site was fully accessible to the public.  Press reaction to the event was mild, dwindling to zero within three days after the bombing.  The incident caused a delay of several months in the construction schedule."

The plane was ordered to Manila where they exchanged the 72 passengers for 12 airline employees, then took off for the Mid-East.  They landed in Bangkok to refuel.  The world's longest hijacking in distance ended on April 17, 1976, ten days after the ordeal began.  The BAC-111 was one of two used in the 8,800 mile hijacking (the hijackers transferred to a DC-8 in Bangkok).  The hijackers consented to the release of their 12 hostages and the surrender of all their weapons except for one pistol.  In return, they were to get a bigger, longer-range jet plane that would take them on to Libya.  The ordeal ended in Benghazi when Libyan authorities let the gunmen into the country for humanitarian reasons.  Witnesses said that the money paid to the hijackers was left behind in the airline bag when they got off the plane.  Libya returned the $300,000 ransom to the Philippine airline."

A Cubana airlines DC-8 jetliner carrying 73 persons crashed just after takeoff, off the coast of Barbados, killing all 73 persons aboard.  Four suspects in the firebombing of the airplane are being held in Venezuela on murder charges.  Sufficient evidence convinced a Venezuelan judge that the plane was deliberately blown up.  A military prosecutor withdrew the charges September 17, 1980; the withdrawal was due to a technical report prepared by Scotland Yard according to which the explosion must have occurred in the plane's cargo area, to which neither Hernan Ricardo and Freddy Lugo (Venezuelans charged with actually placing the bombs in the plane under instructions from Cubans Orlando Bosch and Luis Posada Carriles) had any access.  According to records of the case, the two Venezuelan cameramen flew to Barbados carrying only hand luggage which they still had with them when they left the plane.  It was also verified that the passport Bosch was using under the name of Paniagua had been legally issued to him by the Venezuelan government under instructions from the police department.  The Foreign Minister in Caracas said that there had been no acquittal so far: It was the prosecutor's decision to withdraw the charges, but in penal judiciary issues, in crimes of this nature, once the procedure begins, it only ends with a sentence.  Therefore, for the time being, the final decision is in the hands of the judge. He added that in the event the judge absolves the defendants, the case would have to be reexamined, but the most important point of this issue is a question of law.A consequence of this judgement could be a cancellation of the air piracy agreement between Cuba and Venezuela.  A great many of the victims in the air crash were Cuban athletes, and it appeared that the incident was planned in Venezuela.  President Castro of Cuba recalled all its diplomats from Venezuela on September 28, 1980, as a protest against the acquittal of the four defendants.On August 8, 1982, Posada Carriles and Hernan Ricardo escaped from San Carlos prisons by subduing a prison subordinate official and, using military uniforms, left the prison accompanied by the official, whom they released as soon as they reached the street.  They immediately went to the Chilean Embassy where they requested asylum.  The Embassy handed them over to Venezuelan officials.  Reports from Caracas stated that pressure from the government and public opinion forced the Chilean Embassy in Caracas to hand over the perpetrators of the aircraft sabotage.  The escape created a political upheaval in Venezuela and a full investigation was instigated.  Reports filtered in from Cuba that Fidel Castro had dispatched a group of professional murderers to Venezuela with orders to kill the two saboteurs."

JRA guerrillas hijacked a Japan Airlines plane shortly after takeoff from Bombay and forced it to land in Dacca, Bangladesh. The Japanese government agreed to the terrorists' demand for the release of nine imprisoned Japanese and US $6 million in exchange for the more than 150 hostages on the aircraft.  Ten of the passengers were U.S.  citizens.  Eight passengers were released in Dacca during the next two days.  After the arrival on 1 October of the ransom money and the six released Japanese prisoners who had agreed to join the hijackers, over 100 more passengers were freed.  The aircraft, carrying the remaining hostages, the hijackers, the released Japanese prisoners, and the ransom money, departed Dacca on 2 October for Algeria.  During refueling stops en route in Kuwait and Syria, a total of 17 additional hostages were released.  Upon arrival in Algiers on 3 October, the JRA hijackers and released prisoners surrendered to Algerian authorities and the remaining 19 passengers and crew were freed.It was reported that the operation was planned as long as three months ago by Wadi Haddad's Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (Revolutionary Command) -- superficially a breakaway from George Habash's PFLP, which is said by the Israelis to maintain covert links with it.  Haddad's headquarters have been in South Yemen since the eruption of civil was in Lebanon; however, the Bangladesh operation is said to have been planned, and controlled in detail, from Beirut.The motive is said to have been primarily money.  The Syrians in Lebanon captured large sums of money stashed away by the Palestinian groups.  Although they turned over some of the cash to the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), they refused to give any of it to factions, such as Haddad's, which belong to the so-called 'Rejection Front.' Haddad and his lieutenants apparently felt an urgent need to raise more finance.Bangladesh was selected as the place to take the hijacked plane to because it is fairly close to Japan--from which the ransom and the released prisoners were to come-- and was considered to be in such a state of internal confusion that its government would be exceedingly  unlikely to adopt a hard line toward the hijackers.  A 1978 press release stated that the hijackers had been expelled from Algeria and that they did not have the ransom money when they arrived in Algeria."

Earl Mountbatten of Burma and three others were assassinated by the explosion of a bomb placed on or in the proximity of the Earl's cabin cruiser in Sligo.  It was the beginning of a technically sophisticated campaign by terrorists operating on behalf of Irish revolutionary nationalism.  Responsibility for the Mountbatten killing was initially claimed by the Trotskyist Irish National Liberation Army (INLA); the armed branch of the Irish Republican Socialist Party (IRSP); and later by the Provisional wing of the Irish Republican Army (PIRA).  However, the method involved--the planting of a high-powered bomb and its detonation by remote control--is characteristic of INLA techniques used in previous assassinations and attempted attacks (the murder of the British ambassador to Eire in 1976; the murder of Parliament member Airey Neave in March.)  A 3l-year old Irishman, Thomas McMahon, a leading expert on remote controlled bombs in the provisional wing of the Irish Republican Army, was found guilty on November 23 and sentenced to life in prison.  Another defendant, Francis McGirl, 24, was found not guilty of the murder charge.  There was no jury and there is no appeal. In January 1980, McMahon was acquitted on charges of belonging to the Irish Republic Army.  Frank McGirl was acquitted of being an IRA member.In March 1982, two Irish nationalists who allegedly tried to enter the United States illegally at Buffalo, New York, to buy arms and ammunition, were suspected of being involved in the murder of Lord Mountbatten.  The Buffalo Evening News said Desmond Ellis was described in classified documents as the possible electronics expert and Edward Howell as the brains behind Mountbatten's bomb death.  Ellis sought political asylum in the United States; Howell was returned to Canada after posting $10,000 bond and was arrested by Canadian immigration officials.

They broke down doors and windows in spite of the ambassador's imploring to Guatemalan officials to call off their forces and settle the affair peacefully.  The police stormed the embassy and the cornered peasants threw a Molotov cocktail and set the building ablaze.  At least 39 people died, including the embassy staff.  The ambassador and one of the peasants escaped by jumping from a window. Later the surviving peasant was kidnapped from his hospital room by a group of unknown armed men.  The ambassador denounced the actions of the police as brutal and senseless and in violation of one of the most elementary rules of international law.  He also strongly denied Guatemalan claims that local authorities had been called in by embassy officials.  Outraged by the assault, on February 1, 1980, Spain broke diplomatic relations with Guatemala."

Six armed Iranians took over the Iranian Embassy in London and held 26 hostages for nearly six days.  Three of the hostages were British; the remaining were Iranian diplomats and staff with some foreign visitors.  Police cordoned off the embassy and tried patiently to negotiate with the gunmen through the embassy windows and by telephone.  The gunmen were from Khuzistan, the oil-producing province of Iran on the southern border with Iraq.  They claimed to be members of the Group of the Martyrs and were demanding autonomy for their province in addition to the release of 91 prisoners being held in Khuzistan.  They wanted the prisoners flown to London and then safe passage guaranteed for all, including the hostages, out of the country.  They pledged to not harm non-Iranian hostages and apologized for the trouble they were causing London.  They wanted to deal with the Khomeini government but got little response.  Iran sent an open letter to the gunmen refusing their demands and stating that the Khuzistan prisoners would be executed if any of the embassy staff came to harm.  Bani-Sadr said his government is ready to accept the martyrdom of our children in England rather than submit to blackmail.During the course of the negotiations the gunmen released 5 hostages at separate times.  On the 5th of May, shots were heard and a dead hostage was dumped out the front door of the embassy.  The gunmen informed police that they would kill an additional hostage every 30 minutes until their demands were met--those demands being now simply safe passage out of the country. Authorities immediately sent into action their one plan in reserve. Commandos of the Army's anti- terrorist unit of the Special Air Service Regiment (SAS) stormed the embassy, killing five terrorists and rescuing 19 hostages.  When the black-garbed commandos entered by lowering themselves by ropes from the roof and crawling in windows the gunmen panicked and opened fire on their hostages, wounding several and killing one.   Explosions caused by stun-grenades used by the commandos to disorient the terrorists and catch them by surprise, quickly spread flames through the building and eventually gutted the embassy.  As the hostages were rushed out of the building to safety, their identities were checked.  Mistaken at first for a hostage, one of the gunmen, Fowzi Nejad, 23, was discovered and arrested.  Nicknamed Baby Face by the hostages, he was called a good boy by some of the Iranians but nevertheless was packed off to jail.  Later, in January of 1981, he was sentenced to life imprisonment."

The peasants told reporters they were seeking political refuge and they would stay in the embassy until they were able to speak with a group of foreign ambassadors, including U.S.  Ambassador Robert White, about their demands for an end to government repression in the Salvadoran countryside.  According to the spokesman, the army is killing and torturing peasants.The Costa Rican Ambassador was recalled by his government the next day and began negotiations with his government for political asylum for the peasants.On July 17th, the leftists led another 115 peasants into the already packed eight-room embassy.  The living conditions became unbearable. The following day Costa Rica announced that due to frustations over the deadlock in negotiations it was abandoning all efforts and was moving its embassy.  On the 19th of July, the embassy lost its diplomatic status and the International Red Cross came in to airlift the peasants home.  The leftists refused the airlift and brought in 10 more peasants.  Costa Rica finally did provide asylum to the near 230 peasants, who by now were showing symptoms of contagious diseases. Two airlifts were necessary to carry them to a quarantine in the estate of former Nicaraguan dictator, Somoza, in Costa Rica, under the care of the International Red Cross."

An Iranian who served as press attache at his country's embassy in Washington during the Shah's reign and who had been an outspoken critic of Ayatollah Khomeini, was shot and killed at his home in Bethesda, Md., by an assailant dressed as a postal worker. Ali Akbar Tabatabai, president of the American branch Iran Freedom Foundation, a nonprofit corporation headed by Bakhtiar and dedicated to the creation of a secular democracy in Iran, was well known among diplomats and often appeared on radio and television to speak against the Ayatollah.  Authorities described the slaying as a carefully plotted attempt to silence Khomeini's leading critic.  David Belfield, a black Muslim also known as Daoud Salahuddin, was identified by witnesses within 2 hours of the killing as the key suspect.  Tyrone Frazier, a postal worker, was also detained and charged with being an accessory to murder.  Frazier said his mail truck had been hijacked, but it was discovered after hours of questioning that he had rented the truck to Belfield for $500.  It was later discovered by investigators that Belfield flew to Iran within 3 days of the shooting.  With broken diplomatic ties between Iran and the U.S.  there was little hope of extraditing him for prosecution. Later a fourth suspect was named in the case, but he too had fled the country.  A virtual arsenal of weapons was discovered during a search of his home and was likely Belfield's source of weapons supply. During the investigation, authorities made a connection between this incident and a group of loosely organized black American Muslims who embraced the Islamic beliefs of Khomeini and were violently opposed to his critics.In the summer of 1981, Ahmed Rauf, also known as Horace A.  Butler, Ali Abdul-Mani, also known as Curtis Manning, and William Caffee, Jr., also known as Kalid, were indicted together with Daoud Salahuddin, also known as David Belfield who fled the country, for the execution-style murder of Tabatabai.  The indictment charged the suspects with conspiracy in the killing for a cash payment.  It was revealed that the defendants were overheard in separate conversations during Éelectronic surveillance, approved by the special Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, a 7-member panel created in 1978 by Congress to review electronic surveillance requests by the FBI and the National Security Agency."

Faisal Zagallai was to be interviewed for an interpreter's job; when Zagallai's wife left the room, the interviewer shot Zagallai with a pistol.  He was in stable condition later in the hospital.Two days later, JANA, the official Libyan news agency, reported that the shooting was carried out by the World Revolutionary Committee and termed Zagallai an American spy. JANA reported:  Zagallai had studied at the expense of the Libyan community for 10 years to obtain a legal degree and doctorate, but instead of returning to serve his country and people, he became an agent and spy for American intelligence, supplying it with information about his country. Authorities reported that Zagallai had received threats lately as had other Libyan students at the university.  Zagallai said his assailant appeared to be American and pretended to be a corporate recruiter.Eugene A. Tafoya, a former Green Beret, was charged with the attempted murder of Zagallai, a vocal opponent of Colonel el Qaddafi, the Libyan leader.  He claimed he had acted in self-defense and believed he was working for the CIA when he met with Zagallai to ask him to refrain from his open criticism of Qaddafi.  The CIA disclaimed any association with Tafoya.  Tafoya fled to England where he lived for four months on a farm owned by a former American intelligence agent, Edwin P. Wilson, who is a fugitive in Libya.  FBI agents suspect that Wilson may have been responsible for arranging the attack against Zagallai.  Wilson was indicted in 1980 on charges of exporting explosives to Libya to help train terrorists.  The trial of Tafoya began on November 12. 1981. On December 5, 1981, Tafoya was found guilty of third degree assault and conspiracy.  The conviction carries a maximum sentence of two years."

Kenyan officials suspect the bombing to be revenge against Kenya by the Palestinians for aiding the Israeli commando team that rescued hostages hijacked by Palestinians to Entebbe airport in neighboring Uganda in July 1976.

Unidentified gunmen assassinated two American labor lawyers and a high-ranking Salvadoran agrarian reform official in the dining room of the Sheraton Hotel in San Salvador.  While having coffee after dinner, the three were gunned down in their seats. The gunmen left the hotel by way of the crowded main lobby.  The victims were identified as Jose Rodolfo Viera, president of the Agrarian Transformation Institute, and Mark Pearlman and Michael Hammer, both lawyers for an auxiliary of the AFL-CIO.  Pearlman and Hammer, the two Americans slain, were with the U.S.-supported American Institute for Free Labor Development, and were working under contract advising the Salvadorans on their land reform program.  Since its inception in March 1980, the reform program has been under fire by both political extremes:  the right, because it has taken land away from some of the country's wealthiest families, and the left, because it attempts to take much of the steam out of their Marxist promises.In April, authorities arrested Ricardo Sol Meza, one of the wealthiest men in El Salvador, after he was overheard advocating a coup against Duarte's civilian-military junta.  The day after his arrest, his brother-in-law, Hans Christ, who authorities believed was also involved in the coup conspiracy, arrived in Miami, Florida.  Many former landowners, members of the Salvadoran oligarchy that ruled El Salvador for decades, have settled in Miami.  They have been accused by Duarte and some U.S. officials of funding death squads aimed at moderate and leftist reformers in El Salvador.  One week later, FBI agents arrested Christ who was preparing to leave the country for Germany.  Christ holds dual citizenship in West Germany and El Salvador.  He was held in Miami pending extradition.  In September 1981, authorities released Meza for lack of evidence that he set up the killings of the Americans.In July 1982, investigators in El Salvador secretly reopened an inquiry into the slaying of the two US land reform advisors in anticipation of a review of Salvadoran human rights progress by President Reagan.  The probe was said to have been reopened with the help of the US Embassy, the National Guard and El Salvador's new right-wing government.A Salvadoran army officer suspected of ordering the murders at the behest of Christ was freed by a Salvadoran court for lack of evidence.  Lt Rodolfo Isidrio Lopez Sibrian was ordered released despite testimony from two national guard corporals who confessed to the killings.  The corporals alleged Lopez Sibrian and Capt. Eduardo Avila ordered the murders.  The corporals confessed to gunning down the three men and stated that Hans Christ had waved them into the room.  Under Salvadoran law, however, the testimony of anyone accused of a crime cannot be used against another.   The ruling brought a sharp protest from the American Embassy."

The guerrillas burst into the institute, disguised as police officers, looking for the director, Al Wheeler, who was not there.  After searching the offices and questioning the workers, they took Bitterman instead.  A spokesman for the Movement said that they would release Bitterman when the Colombian government agreed to expel the Summer Institute of Linguistics.  The Institute, known as Wycliffe Bible Co.  at its headquarters in Huntington Beach, California, is regarded by M-19 as a CIA front.  Wycliffe is an interdenominational oranization that trains workers planning to study indigenous languages in Latin America.  Their specialty is developing alphabets for languages that have never been written before and translating the Bible.  An official for the Institute disclaimed any connection with the United States Government.  A deadline of February 19 was imposed for the expulsion; the deadline was then extended for 15 days.  The Institute denied the accusations and refused to yield to the demands and stated it would cooperate fully with the Colombian government in its stand against the guerrillas.  In spite of continuing negotiations with the guerrillas, the second deadline passed.  After 48 days in captivity, Chester Bitterman died at the hands of the leftists.  His body was found the day after the deadline on an abandoned bus.  He had been shot through the heart but had been drugged with a heavy sedative beforehand.

Jordanian Charge d'Affaires Hisham Muheissen was kidnapped in Beirut and the abduction rekindled a potentially explosive dispute between Jordan and Syria, since the Jordan official lived and worked on the western side of Lebanon, where security is under the control of Syrian troops of the Arab Deterrent Force.  Three bodyguards were slain in the abduction of the diplomat and a housemaid (probably mistaken for his wife.) Credit for the attack was claimed by two pro-Syrian groups.  The calls from the Eagles of the Revolution (a unit of al-Saiqa) appeared to be staged; at one point they claimed that they had executed Muheissen and hidden his body.  Credit was properly due an unknown youth militia.  Leaflets were left at the scene by the Pan-Arab Leftist Organization, vanguards of revolutionary violence- Lebanese region. One of the attackers, a civilian, was found dead in a car nearby.  Jordanian leaders were convinced that Syrian agents were responsible for the kidnapping and were threatening reprisals if he was not returned unharmed.  The Syrian government denied any complicity in the incident.  A caller who claimed to represent the terrorists, threatened to kill the charge d'affaires unless Jordan and Iraq surrender seven Syrian defectors within 48 hours.However, it was a little-known Muslim youth militia who released the diplomat on April 14 after holding him captive for 67 days.  The National Confrontation Front said it released Muheissen because of pressure from Damascus.The August issue of Risks International Executive Assessment stated that the kidnapping was conducted by the dissident Palestinian group Assifa, led by Abu Nidal."

A Cuban security guard was beaten and his weapons taken before the takeover.  The invaders were 19 men, 4 women, and 6 children.  Taken hostage were Ambassador Jorge Perez Concha, Embassy secretary Guillermo Bazante, Embassy counselor Francisco Proano, and Mercedes Vazques, a Cuban secretary at the Embassy.  The Embassy invaders vowed to remain until they were granted safe conduct out of Cuba.  Cuban authorities said they would not give in to any demands, and diplomatic sources said Ecuador was not prepared to legitimize the Cubans' actions by granting them asylum. Cuban officials claimed that if asked, its forces would attack the embassy and free it from the armed anti-social elements. After 7 days, on March 20, the assailants handed over their weapons to the hostages who immediately left the embassy.  The group of Cubans remained, and on March 21, the eighth day, they gave up their bid to emigrate and surrendered to Cuban troops who stormed the embassy with tear gas.  They offered no resistance and there was no bloodshed. Ecuador denied that permission had been given for the assault, and issued an energetic protest. The Ecuadorean ambassador had promised the group they could remain in the embassy under its protection and care after they gave up their weapons.Cuba's news agency reported that 13 dissidents had been arrested in what they called a lightning commando raid.

Three armed hijackers seized a Pakistani International Boeing 720 while it was on a flight between Karachi and Peshawar, near the border of Soviet-occupied Afghanistan.  They were believed to be members of Al Zulfikar, a group of pro-Bhutto extremists.  Zia ul-Haq, presently in power in Pakistan, became president after toppling Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who was executed in 1979.The hijackers held 141 people as hostage, including three Americans, two U.S.  residents, and 11 crew members.  The hijackers demanded that Pakistan release at least 70 political prisoners and relatives of leftists or there would be serious consequences.  They threatened to kill the passengers one by one and blow up the plane.  The plane landed in Kabul, Afghanistan, where one diplomat, Tariq Rahim, was shot and his body dumped unceremoniously on the runway.  The shooting took place during a beating incident and may not have been premeditated.  Rahim was Pakistan's diplomat to Teheran.  He was a former aide to Bhutto and suspected of complicity in the 1977 coup that installed Zia as president.  The leader of the hijackers, a Pakistani identified later as Salamullah Khan, said he was prepared to release the women and children if the government of Pakistan would apologize publicly for saying that he belonged to the outlawed Pakistan People's Party.  Twenty nine hostages--women, children and sick men--were released on March 7 in Kabul.Without warning, the plane with more than 100 hostages still on board flew to Damascus, Syria, on March 9 where the terrorists reopened negotiations with Syrian officials and Pakistan's ambassador to Syria. Pakistani officials had agreed to release only 20 political prisoners. On March 12, the Pakistani government agreed to release 55 prisoners; Libya agreed to receive the hijackers and the released prisoners.  In addition, the hijackers also asked for $50,000.  The Pakistanis quickly agreed to that demand.  The leader of the hijackers also asked that a few members of their families be allowed to stay behind in Pakistan to sell any family houses or land, with a promise from Islamabad government that they would be allowed to leave Pakistan freely once their holdings had been liquidated.  Once again, the Pakistanis agreed.The Pakistani prisoners were rounded up and put on a plane headed for Libya.  Enroute, however, Libya inexplicably reversed its original acceptance of the hijackers.  On March 15, after a 13-day siege, Syria agreed to give them asylum with their political prisoners.  The hijackers surrendered as the plane returning from Libya with the 54 political prisoners (one could not be located) was flown to Syria.  There, the hostages were released unharmed.  The hijackers surrendered to Syrian authorities.The admitted victory for the three hijackers brought a storm of criticism from the US and Pakistan for the part played in the negotiations by the Soviets and Afghanistan.  Some officials suggested that the Soviets' lack of action could have been from the fact that the hijackers, political foes of Zia, were almost certainly supported by the Soviet-installed  regime of Karmal in Kabul.   This assessment ascertained that not only did the Kabul regime  support the hijackers' aims, but may have smuggled automatic weapons aboard the aircraft when it was in Kabul.   Hostages later reported they arrived with pistols and left with machine guns."

Five members of the Commando Jihad, or Holy War Command, a group of Muslim extremists dedicated to Iran-style Islamic revolution, brandished machine guns and dynamite as they hijacked a DC-9 belonging to Garauda Indonesian Airways, with 57 passengers including 3 Americans, on a domestic flight over Indonesia.  They diverted the plane to Bangkok after refueling in Malaysia.  There they presented their demands for the release of 20 political prisoners held in Indonesia.  Their other demands included the punishment of the Indonesian Vice President for allegedly taking kickbacks from a U.S. aircraft company and the expulsion of all Jew officials and Israeli militarists from Indonesia.  They also requested $1.5 million dollars as well.  The Indonesian government agreed to all their demands but asked for time to assemble the prisoners and find a country to accept them all.  Sri Lanka was requested by the hijackers but that country refused, saying the crisis should be resolved elsewhere.  The hijackers upped their demands to 80 prisoners and the Indonesians agreed.  Simultaneously, Indonesian President Suharto requested permission of the Thai government to send in commandos and use force to overpower the hijackers.  Reluctantly, Thai officials gave permission but they still hoped to resolve the issue peacefully.At one time during the second day of the hijacking, a British passenger executed a daring escape from the plane by way of an emergency exit.  Another passenger, an American, attempted to duplicate this escape but was shot in the back during the attempt and was dumped on the runway.  A stretcher was sent in and he was hospitalized.  At another point a crewman was wounded and dumped off the plane when he was caught making hand signals to a refueling crew. With information from the escaped Briton, the Indonesian commandos set up a daring rescue attempt.  Very early on the fourth day of the hijacking, on March 31, the commandos stormed the airliner and killed four out of five of the hijackers.  The pilot and a member of the assault team were wounded, but all hostages were freed. It was later reported that a small military team trained in antiterrorist tactics had been flow in from the United States to assist the commandos in their assault.

Pope John Paul II was shot and seriously wounded as he drove through crowds gathered for his weekly public audience in St.  Peter's Square in Vatican City.  Police arrested an escaped Turkish terrorist who was identified as Mehmet Ali Agca, 23.  Two women standing by were injured, one seriously.  The Pope recovered from his wounds after two operations. The assailant apparently hoped to strike at Soviet and U.S. imperialism but the connection to the Pope was not made clear.  He escaped from a Turkish prison shortly before the Pope arrived in Turkey in 1979 where he had made death threats against the Pope.  He had been convicted of the assassination of a prominent Turkish editor in the wave of terrorism that subsequently led to a military takeover, and had been sentenced to death.In July 1981, after a three-day trial, Agca was sentenced to life imprisonment by an Italian court in Rome.  The first year of that sentence was to be spent in solitary confinement.  When read the sentence in his jail cell because he had boycotted the court proceedings on the grounds that the Italian courts could not prosecute him for a crime committed in the Vatican, Agca showed no sign of emotion and told his Italian lawyer that he did not wish to appeal.  He will be eligible to be freed after serving 28 years of his life sentence.  Contrary to the hopes of many, the speedy trial did not serve to answer the questions of motive, and whether Agca had acted alone or had been part of a conspiracy in the assassination attempt.  The court had refused to admit any psychiatric evidence but the overriding impression of Agca was of a fanatic, though as one Turkish journalist stated, Agca likes to play the fanatic, but he's not really like that at all.   High-ranking Turkish officials are convinced that Agca did not act alone but have not been able to identify any accomplices.On August 10, 1982, Italian authorities were expected to file charges against several people suspected of helping Mehmet Ali Agca in his assassination attempt.  Investigators were expected to go to Switzerland and then possibly West Germany, Austria, and Spain to gather information.  Authorities would give no details but said they are continuing to investigate links between Agca, who is Turkish, and a gun-smuggling ring operating in Bulgaria and Turkey.  On November 25, 1982, Serge Ivanov Antonov, an employee of the Bulgarian national airline and tourist office in Rome, was arrested and charged with complicity in the shooting.  There have been no indications of an international plot.  The Bulgarian Communist government demanded the release of the suspect stating that his arrest was groundless and a hostile act against Soviet-aligned Bulgaria.  However, Italian authorities content there were two other gunmen in St. Peter's Square ready to shoot the Pope; Antonov's companion has not been identified.In September 1996 the Turkish gunman made a plea to Italy asking to be pardoned from his life sentence there and to be moved to a prison in Turkey."

Four leftist gunmen hijacked a Turkish Airlines DC-9 en route from Istanbul to Ankara as it left Yesilkoy International Airport.  They ordered the pilot to land at the small military airfield at Burgas in Bulgaria. The hijackers demanded $500,000 and freedom for 47 prisoners in Turkish jails.  They threatened to kill five American banking executives among the 112 passengers aboard and also to blow up the plane if their demands were not met.  Twenty-five women, children, and men with chronic ailments were allowed to leave the plane at Burgas, a resort city on the Black Sea, leaving 91 passengers still in the plane, plus a crew of six.  The Turkish government refused to negotiate and asked Bulgaria to keep the plane from leaving Burgas.Two passengers escaped by jumping from the plane through an emergency exit. Bulgarian officials maintained contact with the hijackers by radio.  The hijackers threatened to kill the five American passengers if their demands were not met by a specified time.  This deadline was extended, then finally abandoned.  The hijackers then asked for 200 envelopes and a quantity of paper so that the hostages could write farewell letters.  The Turkish government continued to refuse to accede to the demands of the terrorists and threatened to execute the 47 jailed leftists if the hijackers carried out their threat to blow up the plane.Twenty-four hours later, on May 25, a dramatic end came to the hijacking. Two of the terrorists were lured from the plane by the promise that they could make a statement to the press.  Once on the ground, they were immediately overpowered.  In an escape set up by hand signals, the pilot of the jetliner sent the plane lurching forward, knocking everyone standing in the plane off their feet.  Some of the passengers then took advantage of the confusion to overpower the two gunmen left.  One terrorist lost his weapon and either jumped or was thrown from the plane.  All 91 passengers were freed.  Five incurred minor injuries when one of the attacked hijackers began to shoot his pistol wildly.  Two of the hijackers were also wounded.The gunmen were identified as members of an extremist Marxist group, Dev Sol, whose members had been severely cracked down on by the Turkish military authorities.  The latter had seized power in September 1980, saying the elected government had been unable to quell violence between the left and right.  Since then, thousands of suspected political extremists have been arrested."

Six hours after the landing in Lahore, the hijackers released 67 passengers, including women, children, foreigners, and members of their own Sikh sect.  The hijackers refused to negotiate directly with Indian government representatives and made no demands.  Instead, in the Indian city of Amritsar, the site of the Sikhs' holiest shrine, a Sikh separatist organization claimed responsibility for the hijacking and demanded the release of Sikh militants from Indian jails.  A member of the governing council of the group said the hijacking was intended to focus the attention of the world to the demands of the Sikhs. Their demands included the release of Jarnail Singh Bhinderwale, leader of the militant Sikh sect, who was arrested last week in connection with the slaying of a Hindu journalist who had criticized Sikh separatism.  They also demanded a half-million dollar ransom and a meeting with the press, and set a deadline for the morning of the following day.Ninety minutes before the deadline, Pakistani commandos dressed as cleaning men entered the plane, overpowered the hijackers and rescued all the remaining hostages.  None of the hostages were injured in the operation.Indian Airlines officials reported that the leader of the group had been identified as Gajender Singh, an officer of the Dal Khalsa, or Society of the Pure, an organization of students and other young Sikhs who seek an independent state.  Seven weeks ago, in an interview, Mr. Singh had said that his group was seeking to pattern itself after the Palestine Liberation Organization and that it was prepared to use terrorism, which he called the political language of the 20th century."

Israeli Ambassador to Britain Shlomo Argov was shot and critically wounded in the head while leaving a banquet in London by an assailant wielding a submachine gun and aided by accomplices. The Palestine Liberation Organization denied having anything to do with the attack but Israel warned of retaliation.  Five weeks later, Israeli planes bombarded Lebanese PLO targets and Israeli troops moved in and was taken into custody.  Three Arabs--two Jordanians and one Iraqi-- were later arrested and charged.  The three belong to a dissident Arab terrorist group named Black June that now operates out of Syria and is openly hostile to PLO leader Yasser Arafat.  The shooting of Argov was a critical event in the sequence leading to Israel's invasion of Lebanon. On June 10, a dissident Palestinian group called al-Asifa, which split from the PLO in the early 1970s, claimed responsibility for the assassination attempt.

The government has stepped up the search for the six kidnapped, and has offered a $13,000 reward for information leading to their safe recovery. Follow-up on various rumors of sightings of the tourists in the area have been fruitless.  The political prisoners in question are expected to be brought to trial on January 10, 1983.  The bodies of the six tourists were found in March 1985 and were determined to have been killed three days after their abduction.  Five people were convicted of the murders and were hanged for the crime on April 7, 1986."

They then escaped, disappearing into the Shiite-controlled territory around the airport.On September 13 1987, Fawaz Younis, believed to have been the leader of the terrorist cell involved in this hijacking (and also thought to have been involved in the 1985 hijacking of a TWA Boeing 727 en-route from Athens to Rome in which a U.S. serviceman was killed - see incident 4209) was lured onto a yacht by the FBI.  He is currently awaiting trial in the U.S.  Shiite Moslems have threatened attacks against U.S. interests if Younis is not freed.In February 1988 a U.S. District Judge ruled that Younis could be charged with leading the hijacking, but that he could not be prosecuted for allegedly assaulting passengers and blowing up the Jordanian Airline jet. The judge did not dismiss six conspiracy and hijacking counts of the indictment and upheld the use of Navy vessels that transported Younis after his arrest aboard the FBI-chartered yacht in the Mediterranean.  Younis claims that Lebanese Justice Minister Nabih Berri approved the hijacking.On March 14, 1989, Younis became the first person convicted of criminal charges under provisions of a 1984 law that makes holding Americans hostage anywhere in the world a crime.

When the Syrian government denied them permission to land, the ship veered on toward Cyprus before returning to Egyptian waters on Wednesday.  The terrorists had demanded the release of 50 Palestinian prisoners held in Israel, as well as freedom for other Palestinians imprisoned elsewhere.  American passengers were separated from the other passengers and threatened with flammable liquids during the ordeal.  One American passenger, Leon Klinghoffer, an invalid in a wheelchair, was shot in the head and thrown overboard by his captors.

The plane was forced to land in Italy where the four were held by Italian authorities and charged with murder and kidnapping.  Italy released the other two Palestinians, under U.S. protest, although it is believed that one of them, Mohammed Abbas Zaida (aka Abu al-'Abbas), was actually the mastermind behind the hijacking.In July 1986 an Italian court found Abu al-'Abbas guilty and sentenced him in absentia to life in prison.

An Egyptian jetliner carrying more than 100 people on a flight from Athens to Cairo was hijacked by terrorists who originally identified themselves as members of Egypt Revolution.  Ten minutes out of Athens, the hijackers began frisking the passengers and collecting passports.  During the passport check, one of the terrorists came across an Egyptian security guard who pulled out a gun and killed the terrorist.  A gunfight between the other terrorists and the security guard ensued, and the guard was killed.  The gunfight depressurized the plane, which was forced to land in Malta.  The airport landing lights had been turned off.  Tension built steadily once the plane was on the ground, and the terrorists began systematically shooting passengers.  An Israeli girl, selected by her passport, was the first to be taken to the plane's platform and killed. Five minutes later, another Israeli girl was shot; she remains brain dead. Three Americans were selected after that.  One of them was killed and two of them survived, although the hijackers believed them to be dead. With the permission of the Maltese government, an Egyptian anti-terrorist unit stormed the plane in a lightning assault.  The terrorists threw three phosphorus grenades in the front and rear of the plane, which started large fires and spread burning shrapnel.

They retreated and seized a car outside Schwechat Airport leading police on a chase before their vehicle was halted.  One terrorist was killed and two were wounded and taken into custody.  Both of the terrorists claim to belong to the Abu Nidal organization operating out of Libya. The three were traveling on Tunisian passports.  The original plan of the terrorists had been to attack the El Al area of the airport, seize hostages, hijack an aircraft and explode it in or over Tel Aviv.  The shootout at the airport disrupted the plan and resulted in the deaths of two bystanders and one of the terrorists and the wounding of 39 other persons.  The two captured terrorists are being charged with murder."

He had been in Beirut working on a book regarding the Middle Eastern situation.  At the time of the abduction, Glass was traveling with Ali Osseiran, son of Lebanon's defense minister.  It appears that the gunmen had originally planned on kidnapping only Glass; however, when Osseiran, (who is a Shiite Moslem) began to protest Glass's treatment, the gunmen grabbed him along with his chauffeur-bodyguard, Suleiman Salman. The Hizballah Party of God is believed responsible, although the group issued a statement of denial.Salman and Osseiran were blindfolded and set free on the coastal highway near the city of Sidon on June 24. A few days after their release, a one-page typewritten statement written in Arabic was left at the door of a Lebanese radio correspondent in Sidon, claiming the kidnapping on behalf of a group called The Organization for the Defense of Free People.  The statement claimed that Glass was actually an Israeli agent.On July 1, NBC News reported that U.S. intelligence had intercepted messages between the Iranian Embassy in Damascus, Syria and Hezbollah forces in Lebanon providing conclusive evidence that Iran had ordered the kidnapping of Glass.In mid-July Glass' kidnappers released a video tape in which Glass described himself as a U.S. spy.Glass was able to escape from his captors on August 18, 1987, two months after he was taken prisoner.
