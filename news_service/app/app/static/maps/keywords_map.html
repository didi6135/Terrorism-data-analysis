Israel's embassy in Abu Dhabi has been in contact with Kogan's family in the UAE, the statement said, and family members living Israel have also been updated.  The statement called the killing of Kogan "a despicable antisemitic act of terror" and pledged that Israel would use all available means to bring the killers to justice.  The Ynet news site reported that Kogan's car was found abandoned in Al Ain, around 150 kilometers (93 miles) from Abu Dhabi, where Kogan was based. It added, without citing sources, that there were signs of a struggle in the vehicle.  Officials suspect a number of Uzbek citizens recruited by Iran assaulted the rabbi and later fled to Turkey, the report said.  An unnamed official close to UAE authorities told Channel 12 that the country was angry and in shock, adding that senior state and religious officials were investigating.  "It happened after years when there wasn't an unusual security or nationalistic incident," the official was quoted as saying.  Kogan had been missing and presumed dead since Thursday.  Lawmakers and ministers in Israel released a flood of statements Sunday grieving his death and vowing a response to the murder.  President Isaac Herzog said he mourned "with sorrow and outrage," adding in a post on X: "This vile antisemitic attack is a reminder of the inhumanity of the enemies of the Jewish people.  "It will not deter us from continuing to grow flourishing communities in the UAE or anywhere - especially with the help of the dedicated commitment and work of the Chabad emissaries all over the world."  Herzog also thanked UAE authorities for their "swift action," and said he trusted they will do all they can to bring the killers to justice.  Foreign Minister Israel Katz wrote on X that "Israel will not rest nor be silent until those responsible for this criminal act pay for their actions."  "The State of Israel mourns the death of Rabbi Zvi Kogan," Opposition Leader Yair Lapid wrote on X, calling the killing an "antisemitic terror incident" and vowing that the UAE and Israel would cooperate in the investigation.  National Unity chair Benny Gantz also shared his grief on X, vowing that Israel would act and that his "death will not be in vain."  Following the incident, the National Security Council reiterated its travel warning to the UAE, saying there remains a threat against Israelis and Jews in the country.  The UAE has a Level 3 travel warning, the NSC said, meaning all nonessential travel should be avoided.  "Avoid visiting businesses, gathering places, and entertainment venues identified with the Israeli and Jewish population," the warning said. "Maintain increased vigilance in public places (including restaurants, hotels, bars, etc.). Avoid displaying Israeli symbols. Cooperate with local security forces, follow their instructions, and report immediately if you have been exposed to terror activity."  Travelers are also urged to avoid posting on social media and to lock their profiles online.  Kogan was a dual Israeli-Moldovan citizen, and has been part of the Abu Dhabi Chabad chapter since Israel normalized ties with the UAE in late 2020 under a US-brokered agreement dubbed the Abraham Accords. It has maintained the relationship throughout Israel's ongoing 13-month war in Gaza.  According to Ynet, Kogan participated in the first ever Holocaust remembrance day ceremony in the Gulf state in 2021, and led the Yizkor prayer during the event.  Kogan is the nephew of Rabbi Gavriel Holtzberg, who was murdered along with his wife in a terror attack at the Nariman Chabad House in Mumbai in 2008.  Israel has been on high alert for Iranian efforts to harm Israelis and Jews around the world through its various agents and proxies, after the countries exchanged direct military blows for the first time this year.  Iran launched major drone and ballistic missile attacks against Israel in April and October, in response to Israeli strikes on its proxies in Lebanon and Syria. In late October, Israel retaliated with a series of strikes in which dozens of aircraft targeted strategic military sites across Iran as well as air defense batteries.  Iran has vowed to respond but has not yet done so in any major capacity.<br><b>Location:</b> Abu Dhabi<br><b>Date:</b> 2024-11-24T09:27:18Z<br><b>Source:</b> timesofisrael.com<br></div>`)[0];

The attack, carried out by 10 terrorists from Pakistan, remains one of the deadliest in India's history, claiming the lives of 166 people. While nine attackers were gunned down by Indian security forces, one surviving terrorist, Ajmal Kasab, was captured, tried, and later executed in November 2012.  Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath also paid his respects to the victims of the attack, offering a heartfelt tribute to the lives lost. "Humble tribute to the innocent citizens who lost their lives in the cowardly terror attack in Mumbai on 26/11 and heartfelt salute to the brave sons of Mother India who sacrificed their lives while performing their duties in this incident that tarnished humanity!" Adityanath said in a post on X.  Advertisement  He further expressed his resolve to fight terrorism, stating, "Let us be united and determined to end terrorism."  Maharashtra Deputy Chief Ministers Devendra Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar, as well as the state's Governor C.P. Radhakrishnan, paid solemn tributes at the Martyrs Memorial in Mumbai, located on the premises of the Mumbai Police Commissioner's Office.  In a post on X, Union Home Minister Amit Shah condemned terrorism as "a blot on the entire human civilization," while praising India's stance against such violence. "The Modi government's 'zero tolerance' policy against terrorism has been appreciated by the entire world," Shah noted, saying that under this leadership, "India has become a world leader in anti-terrorism initiatives."  Defence Minister Rajnath Singh also took to X to mark the occasion, writing, "We remember, and we will never forget those wounds,".<br><b>Location:</b> Mumbai<br><b>Date:</b> 2024-11-26T06:15:52Z<br><b>Source:</b> The Indian Express<br></div>`)[0];

The man -- Taleb A., according to a report from The Guardian -- fled to Germany as a Saudi Arabian refugee in 2006 and gained official refugee status in 2016.  The 50-year-old left his home country due to its Islamic government and settled in Bernburg, where he worked as a doctor and psychotherapist after receiving his permanent status, according to the Wall Street Journal.  He was prominent in the Saudi community in Germany as an anti-Islam and women's rights activist -- running a website and social media channels dedicated to those causes, the Journal reports.  On his website, he warned prospective refugees to eschew Germany due to what he perceived as the government's tolerance of radical Islam.  The man also posted pro-Israel content in the wake of the Oct. 7 terror attack and was a supporter of Germany's rightwing anti-immigration party AfD, the newspaper reported.  In social media posts days before the attack, the suspect criticized the German government, claiming it was promoting the European nation's Islamization, and also alleged authorities were censoring him because of his views, according to The Wall Street Journal.  Taleb A. is accused of plowing his car through a crowded Christmas market in Madgeburg, injuring dozens and killing at least 2, including a small child, in what authorities are calling a suspected terror attack.  Police operations remain ongoing in Magdeburg and Bernburg, where the suspect lives, The Guardian reports.  The attack comes one day after the anniversary of the 2016 Berlin Christmas market attack that killed 12 people and injured 56 in the deadliest terror attack in German history.<br><b>Location:</b> Magdeburg<br><b>Date:</b> 2024-12-21T05:22:58Z<br><b>Source:</b> New York Post<br></div>`)[0];

Following numerous allegations and charges against the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) over its ties to terrorists with involvement in the Hamas terrorist massacre in Israel, the scandal-hit agency is facing new allegations of wrongdoing.  U.N. Watch a Geneva-based NGO, has released parts of a 150-page dossier that Executive Director Hillel Neuer told Fox News Digital shows "high-level UNRWA staff who are complicit with terrorists, who meet with them regularly."  Before presenting his documentation to the world, Neuer attempted to address it directly with UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini. In a letter to Lazzarini, Neuer explained that Lazzarini's staff have previously complained that U.N. Watch did not submit its reports to UNRWA for comment prior to publishing. Neuer then recounted several attempts to meet personally with Lazzarini to discuss U.N. Watch's findings and explained that when it released its dossier, Lazzarini would be unable to "claim... that we do not show you the evidence in advance."  UN, ISRAEL AT ODDS OVER CAUSE OF DECLINE IN AID DELIVERIES: 'FALSE NARRATIVES BY INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY'  Neuer's group then released photographs of senior UNRWA staff, including Lazzarini and former UNRWA Commissioner-General Pierre Krahenbuhl, meeting with alleged terror leaders. "You wouldn't find these photos on [UNRWA officials'] own social media," he said. "We found them our own ways, but they don't post them."  Neuer pointed Fox News Digital to two undated photos showing Lazzarini meeting with groups that included members of terror organizations, including the Jihadi Islamic Movement, the Islamic Ansar League, and Hamas.  In another photo dating back to late 2014, multiple UNRWA regional directors met with senior Hamas member Ali Baraka. Neuer said, and reporting from Al Watan Voice confirms, that the UNRWA staff wanted to "to congratulate [Baraka] on Hamas' anniversary."  In another instance, Neuer said he was able to find a photo and transcript from a February 2017 meeting between former UNRWA chief Pierre Krahenbuhl, Baraka, members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), and others. According to U.N. Watch, Krahenbuhl reportedly told the assembly that "we are united, and no one can separate us."  In September 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice announced "terrorism, murder conspiracy, and sanctions-evasion charges" against Baraka and five other Hamas leaders for their roles in Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, terror attack, which killed 40 Americans and over 1,000 others.  UN ACCUSED OF DOWNPLAYING HAMAS TERRORISTS' USE OF GAZA HOSPITALS AS NEW REPORT IGNORES IMPORTANT DETAILS  Krahenbuhl and his staff were investigated in 2019 for reports of "sexual misconduct, nepotism, retaliation, discrimination and other abuses of authority." Krahenbuhl resigned from his position, but in April 2024 was named the head of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). Leading congressional voices requested that Secretary of State Antony Blinken and U.S. Agency for International Development Administrator Samantha Power "persuade the ICRC to reconsider this appointment" given Krahenbuhl's "disastrous tenure" as UNRWA commissioner-general.  Fox News Digital asked the ICRC about the photos of Krahenbuhl posing with terror leaders, and of congressional concern about his fitness for the position in the Red Cross. An spokesperson told Fox News Digital that the ICRC "was not present in the meeting, so it cannot speak to the full context of the discussion."  They also stated that Krahenbuhl "has demonstrated through his work at ICRC and his decades of humanitarian experience that he has one objective: to secure aid to civilians in conflict zones. Meeting with any group that controls access to civilians, is an essential part of the ICRC work and other humanitarian organizations in conflict zones."  U.N. Watch's latest dossier also includes interviews of UNRWA students taken by local Palestinian film crews over a period of three weeks during the summer of 2024. In one interview, a 14-year-old former student of UNRWA's Ein Arik co-ed school said that his school taught him "'to fight back and resist' so that 'Palestine will be liberated and our lands will return to us by the good grace of Allah.'" The child later explains that the solution for Jerusalem is to "kill the Jews. We get rid of the Jews."  A second NGO, IMPACT-se has reported extensively on educational materials used in UNRWA schools for over two decades. In a Nov. 13 report, IMPACT-se names 12 high-ranking UNRWA principals, deputies, directors or deputy directors of training centers who held membership in either Hamas or PIJ. The report notes that nine of the 12 participated in the terror attack of Oct. 7, with "some even serving as Nukhba operatives," members of the special forces units of Hamas. Two of the dual UNRWA- and Hamas-member principals headed schools "under which Hamas tunnels were built."  ISRAELI PARLIAMENT BANS UNRWA OVER TERRORISM TIES, FACES INTERNATIONAL BACKLASH  The latest IMPACT-se review complements findings from March 2023 that two UNRWA schools headed by Hamas members had "promote[d] violence and terrorism in self-created study material." Now, IMPACT-se has named three additional schools where Hamas operatives served as UNRWA staff. The NGO found that these schools promoted "libels against and non-recognition of Israel" and "gratuitously insert[ed] content promoting hatred and violence against Israel into grammar exercises."  IMPACT-se found that UNRWA schools are "shamelessly flout[ing]" UNESCO standards, which include "peace-building, respect for non-Palestinian groups, and avoiding incitement to violence."  The group's report cites intelligence claiming that "over 10% of the 510 [senior] employees in UNRWA's education system in the Gaza Strip," are members of PIJ or Hamas. UNRWA members are not allowed to be participants in terror groups designated by the U.N. Security Council. But as Neuer explained, "The U.N. terror list is one of the thinnest lists in the world," because "Russia and China can block any designation they don't like." Neuer said this means "there's virtually no Palestinian groups" on the list.  Fox News Digital reached out to UNRWA media officials on numerous occasions for its response to the contents of IMPACT-se's and U.N. Watch's dossiers, about allegations that UNRWA schools were not adhering to UNESCO standards, and about Lazzarini's refusal to meet with Neuer.  Bill Deere, director of the UNRWA representative office in Washington, told Fox News Digital, "UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini has cautioned the spread of disinformation against UNRWA," which he says "is meant to create chaos and divert attention from the political aims to dismantle the Agency." Reiterating the content of a statement Lazzarini shared on X in the aftermath of Neuer's dossier being released, Deere said, "UNRWA recommends before giving oxygen to accusations like these, double-check the source and question the intent to avoid becoming an echo chamber for disinformation and de facto the fueling of hate and putting other people's lives in danger."  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Addressing U.N. Watch's interviews with UNRWA students, he said, "What they don't tell you is these children were filmed without the knowledge or permission of their parents," Deere said. "The kids were isolated and asked a series of leading questions designed to elicit a response. This is beyond misleading, it's twisted and desperate."  The U.S. was among numerous countries to pause support to UNRWA in January after the initial proofs emerged of members' participation in the terror attack of Oct. 7. Congress has halted funding to UNRWA through March 2025.<br><b>Location:</b> Geneva<br><b>Date:</b> 2024-12-08T16:25:30Z<br><b>Source:</b> Fox News<br></div>`)[0];

The pro-Palestinian Bronx Anti-War Coalition, a self-described "working-class, BIPOC-led, anti-imperialist" group, organized a rally on Sunday in New York City's Union Square to express solidarity with the "Axis of Resistance," which the group identified as Hezbollah, Iran, Syria, Yemen, and the Iraqi "resistance."  At the event, a speaker donning a keffiyeh issued sharp proclamations, including: "Stop pointing fingers at each other. Our fingers, our pens, our rifles will be pointed at the U.S. government, the Zionist entity, and nobody else."  The rally featured chants repeated by the crowd, calling out "U.S. imperialists" as the "number one terrorists" and voicing unity with regional terror movements.  Participants were seen waving flags representing the Palestinians; Iran, the leading state sponsor of terror; Iraq, where Iranian-backed militias hold significant influence; Lebanon, home to Hezbollah; Syria under Assad's regime, notorious for brutal crackdowns during its civil war; and Yemen, where the Houthi rebels align with Iran.  These were seen alongside Hezbollah's yellow flag, a known emblem of armed resistance and Islamic terror.  Hezbollah, which has actively sought to expand its influence beyond the Middle East, is designated a terrorist organization by more than a dozen countries and international entities, including major Western nations, members of the European Union, and most Arab League member states, due to its involvement in terrorist activities against American, French, Israeli, and other targets.  Former President Donald Trump has denounced Hezbollah, stating, "No terrorist group other than al-Qaeda has more American blood on its hands." Meanwhile, Arkansas Republican Sen. Tom Cotton has called for the elimination of "all of Hezbollah's leadership" while insisting that the United States "should let Israel win" against Tehran's key terrorist proxy in the region.  The event also emphasized anti-sectarianism, with the speaker urging the crowd to "rise above religious differences" and focus on a shared cause.  The "anti-capitalism" Bronx Anti-War Coalition amplified their message on social media, sharing a video of Hamas spokesperson Abu Obeida denouncing sectarianism, as well as a speech by Hezbollah Secretary-General Naim Qassam streamed from Iran's Press TV.  In response, critics took to social media to express outrage over the rally's rhetoric.  "The day will come when these Palestine 'activists' inevitably execute a massive terror attack in NYC. And once they do, don't say we didn't warn you," wrote journalist Eitan Fischberger.  "Hey @RealTomHoman, here are some prime deportation candidates!" wrote conservative commentator Dave Rubin.  "It's never been about Israel, it's always been about destroying Western civilization," wrote activist Eyal Yakoby.  The matter comes as the trend of anti-American sentiment at pro-Palestinian events continues to grow.  According to world-renowned military historian and professor Dr. Victor Davis Hanson, Hamas's "death cult" relies on "useful Western idiots" to support the Palestinian cause, which has "fused with the leftwing DEI industry."  In addition, he predicted over a year ago that pro-Palestinian protests and support for Hamas in the U.S. have alienated many Americans and would all but ensure a tough conservative president in 2024.<br><b>Location:</b> New York City<br><b>Date:</b> 2024-12-18T03:40:36Z<br><b>Source:</b> Breitbart<br></div>`)[0];

The number of victims was not immediately clear.  The driver of the car was arrested, German news agency dpa reported, citing unidentified government officials in the state of Saxony-Anhalt.  Many police officers and emergency services were at the scene, and the Christmas market manager had told people to leave the city centre, according to broadcaster MDR.  A car apparently drove straight into the crowd at the Christmas market, heading in the direction of the town hall, according to eyewitnesses cited by the broadcaster.  Magdeburg, which is west of Berlin, is the state capital of Saxony-Anhalt and has about 240,000 inhabitants.  On 19 December 2016 in Berlin, an Islamist extremist attacker drove a truck into a crowd of Christmas market-goers, leaving 13 people dead and dozens more injured. The attacker was killed days later in a shootout in Italy.  German interior minister Nancy Faeser had said late last month that there were no concrete indications of a danger to Christmas markets this year, but that it was wise to be vigilant.<br><b>Location:</b> Magdeburg<br><b>Date:</b> 2024-12-20T19:51:52Z<br><b>Source:</b> The Guardian<br></div>`)[0];
