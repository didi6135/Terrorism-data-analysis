(Credit: KWTX)  At least five people were injured, and a suspect was killed, after a man drove his pickup truck through the glass doors of a J.C. Penney in a mall in Texas, police said.  The incident happened on Saturday evening, just days before Christmas, at the Killeen Mall in Killeen, Texas - which is about 70 miles north of Austin.  In a press conference on Saturday evening, Texas Department of Public Safety Sgt. Bryan Washko said that the truck was driven "several hundred yards" through the entrance of the J.C. Penney store.  Startled shoppers were injured as the driver was "actively running people over" and a fifth went to the hospital on their own, Sergeant Washko said. Those injured ranged from 6 to 75 years old, he said.  5 DEAD, MANY INJURED AFTER MAN DRIVES INTO GERMAN CHRISTMAS MARKET IN SUSPECTED TERROR ATTACK: REPORT  WATCH:  The incident unfolded as authorities noticed that the suspect, who has not been identified, was seen "driving erratically," and police attempted to pull him over.

The 50-year-old left his home country due to its Islamic government and settled in Bernburg, where he worked as a doctor and psychotherapist after receiving his permanent status, according to the Wall Street Journal.

On his website, he warned prospective refugees to eschew Germany due to what he perceived as the government's tolerance of radical Islam.  The man also posted pro-Israel content in the wake of the Oct. 7 terror attack and was a supporter of Germany's rightwing anti-immigration party AfD, the newspaper reported.  In social media posts days before the attack, the suspect criticized the German government, claiming it was promoting the European nation's Islamization, and also alleged authorities were censoring him because of his views, according to The Wall Street Journal.  Taleb A. is accused of plowing his car through a crowded Christmas market in Madgeburg, injuring dozens and killing at least 2, including a small child, in what authorities are calling a suspected terror attack.  Police operations remain ongoing in Magdeburg and Bernburg, where the suspect lives, The Guardian reports.

Israel Hayom reported Sunday:  A senior Hamas official currently based in Turkey told Saudi media that the 37th anniversary of the terrorist organization's founding comes during a period of decline due to defeats in Gaza and the broader region.  The official disclosed, "Hamas is suffering from a genuine leadership crisis. The Al-Aqsa Flood attack backfired on us, submerging us in a sea of blood and crises. The most recent blow was the fall of Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria, with which Hamas had been attempting to rebuild relations."  According to a report by the Saudi news site Elaph, the Syrian government has ordered Palestinian terrorist groups to shut down their offices, hand over their weapons, dismantle training camps, and leave Syria as soon as possible. The primary Palestinian group active in Syria has been the Islamic Jihad. In contrast, Hamas's political bureau left Syria earlier due to its support for Islamist rebels at the start of the Syrian civil war, which sparked a rift with Assad.  Israel Hayom also cited reporting that Palestinian terrorists in Syria fled to Iran, but may leave for other countries due to the fear of assassination (Israel is suspected of having killed Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in July.)  There are also Hamas officials in Turkey, and some are in Qatar -- including some who reportedly returned there at the urging of the incoming Trump administration, solely for the purpose of negotiating a hotage deal by January 20.  The report that Hamas leaders are accepting that the October 7 terror attack was a strategic mistake is a reversal from past months, and suggests that Israel is succeeding in restoring a deterrent against its enemies.  However, there are European nations who continue to reward Hamas, with Ireland the latest to join South Africa's "genocide" case against Israel at the International Court of Justice. Ireland, Spain, and Norway also recognized a Palestinian state.<br><b>Location:</b> Turkey<br><b>Date:</b> 2024-12-15T19:03:02Z<br><b>Source:</b> Breitbart<br></div>`)[0];

According multiple Infowars sources as well as whistleblowers posting online, the mysterious fleets of drones being sighted around the United States in recent weeks may be searching for a nuclear weapon that has been smuggled into the country.  The CEO of Saxon Aerospace John Ferguson recently posted a viral TikTok video claiming he knows a person who had knowledge of an old "nuclear warhead" left over from Ukraine by Moscow after the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union.  "I spoke to a gentleman a few months ago, who was trying to raise the alarm to the highest levels of our government...about this one particular nuclear warhead that he physically put his hands on...that was left over from Ukraine...and he knew this thing was headed towards the United States," Ferguson said.  He continued to assess that the drones being sighted on the East Coast are trying to look for radioactive materials, and pointed out the Biden administration is "pushing to get into war with Russia," suggesting a nuke set off in the U.S. could be blamed on the Vladimir Putin-led nation.  Infowars founder Alex Jones commented on the post, writing, "The American's information below is 100% correct. But there is a catch. He is only 100% right about one component. I have been waiting over the last week until I think through the second and third order consequences of telling you what I know. Stand by for the information today. If you ever ignored my warnings in the past and later, wished you would have listened, you want to pay attention now..."  After top podcast host Joe Rogan said Ferguson's video is the first take on the drones that has him "genuinely concerned," Jones replied, "I have confirmed with my sources in USNORTHCOM that this is indeed the purported reason the drones are swarming the NJ/NY area. But there is a lot more to it. I am headed in to the office to shoot a report that will be released today."  As Ferguson's video exploded online, another thread caught the internet's eye as an 𝕏 user called JerseyFutures claiming to be an RF engineer, who has since deleted the account, also alleged the drones are American-made aircraft trying to detect the presence of nuclear radiation from miles away.  The post suggested the U.S. military drones may be looking for a "dirty bomb" around New York.  Meanwhile, the Geiger Counter World Map, which is currently experiencing off and on server issues, has been showing concerning radiation counts on the East Coast.  Confirming the drones are active in New York, Democrat NY Governor Kathy Hochul issued a statement on Saturday revealing the aircraft caused "runways at Stewart Airfield" to be "shut down for approximately one hour," adding, "This has gone too far."  Now, with the chatter that Russia could be blamed in a scenario where a bomb from Ukraine was smuggled into the U.S., it's worth going back to 2022 statements from Russia warning a nuclear false flag could be carried out and blamed on the Kremlin.  In March 2022, Ukraine's Director of Institute for Safety Problems of Nuclear Power Plants (ISPNPP), Anatolii Nosovskyi, warned that looters allegedly stole radioactive isotopes that could be used to make a "dirty bomb" after Russia gained control over the Chernobyl monitoring lab.  Just weeks prior to Nosovskyi's accusation, Russia's Ambassador to Iraq Elbrus Kutrashev said fears of Ukraine deploying a dirty bomb against Russia were a leading factor in the decision to invade Ukraine in the first place.  "Nuclear. [They planned to use] nuclear waste in a bomb, and attack Russia or Russian interests, or maybe a concentration of Russians," he said. "This forced us to choose as a priority of our special operation in Ukraine taking control of the nuclear plant in Chernobyl. We accomplished this successfully at the beginning of the operation."  Alex Jones' 2022 analysis:  The Western mainstream narrative at the time was that Putin allowed the materials to be stolen, which is unconfirmed, in order to engage in a "false flag" dirty bomb attack against Russia.  Moscow has repeatedly warned Western nations about Kiev's alleged plans to use a "dirty bomb" in Ukraine to frame Russia.  Of course, with the CIA and NATO using Ukraine as a proxy army, it is the West that would be behind the dirty bomb plot if Kiev was "behind" an attack.  In July of this year, United Kingdom Parliament Member Andrew Bridgen claimed NATO and other parties were planning a false flag attack on a European city by detonating a nuclear "dirty bomb" to be blamed on Russia and launch WWIII.  Iran could also be blamed for the attack, as Republican Congressman Jefferson Van Drew of New Jersey claimed earlier this month that the New Jersey drones are being launched from an Iranian "mothership" stationed off the East Coast of the United States.  With President-elect Donald Trump set to take office for his second term, is it possible the Deep State scheme to detonate a dirty bomb in Ukraine or Europe was altered to now take place in New York or Washington D.C. in order to disrupt his presidency?  The American political establishment could even try to take Trump out (again) and come in as the saviors, telling the public the drones were trying to keep them safe from the dirty bomb threat and promising retaliation on whoever they blame.

The pro-Palestinian Bronx Anti-War Coalition, a self-described "working-class, BIPOC-led, anti-imperialist" group, organized a rally on Sunday in New York City's Union Square to express solidarity with the "Axis of Resistance," which the group identified as Hezbollah, Iran, Syria, Yemen, and the Iraqi "resistance."  At the event, a speaker donning a keffiyeh issued sharp proclamations, including: "Stop pointing fingers at each other. Our fingers, our pens, our rifles will be pointed at the U.S. government, the Zionist entity, and nobody else."  The rally featured chants repeated by the crowd, calling out "U.S. imperialists" as the "number one terrorists" and voicing unity with regional terror movements.  Participants were seen waving flags representing the Palestinians; Iran, the leading state sponsor of terror; Iraq, where Iranian-backed militias hold significant influence; Lebanon, home to Hezbollah; Syria under Assad's regime, notorious for brutal crackdowns during its civil war; and Yemen, where the Houthi rebels align with Iran.  These were seen alongside Hezbollah's yellow flag, a known emblem of armed resistance and Islamic terror.  Hezbollah, which has actively sought to expand its influence beyond the Middle East, is designated a terrorist organization by more than a dozen countries and international entities, including major Western nations, members of the European Union, and most Arab League member states, due to its involvement in terrorist activities against American, French, Israeli, and other targets.  Former President Donald Trump has denounced Hezbollah, stating, "No terrorist group other than al-Qaeda has more American blood on its hands." Meanwhile, Arkansas Republican Sen. Tom Cotton has called for the elimination of "all of Hezbollah's leadership" while insisting that the United States "should let Israel win" against Tehran's key terrorist proxy in the region.  The event also emphasized anti-sectarianism, with the speaker urging the crowd to "rise above religious differences" and focus on a shared cause.  The "anti-capitalism" Bronx Anti-War Coalition amplified their message on social media, sharing a video of Hamas spokesperson Abu Obeida denouncing sectarianism, as well as a speech by Hezbollah Secretary-General Naim Qassam streamed from Iran's Press TV.  In response, critics took to social media to express outrage over the rally's rhetoric.  "The day will come when these Palestine 'activists' inevitably execute a massive terror attack in NYC. And once they do, don't say we didn't warn you," wrote journalist Eitan Fischberger.  "Hey @RealTomHoman, here are some prime deportation candidates!" wrote conservative commentator Dave Rubin.  "It's never been about Israel, it's always been about destroying Western civilization," wrote activist Eyal Yakoby.  The matter comes as the trend of anti-American sentiment at pro-Palestinian events continues to grow.  According to world-renowned military historian and professor Dr. Victor Davis Hanson, Hamas's "death cult" relies on "useful Western idiots" to support the Palestinian cause, which has "fused with the leftwing DEI industry."  In addition, he predicted over a year ago that pro-Palestinian protests and support for Hamas in the U.S. have alienated many Americans and would all but ensure a tough conservative president in 2024.<br><b>Location:</b> New York City<br><b>Date:</b> 2024-12-18T03:40:36Z<br><b>Source:</b> Breitbart<br></div>`)[0];

In a post on X, the AP shared an article with the title, "At least 2 dead and 60 hurt after a car drives into a German Christmas market in a suspected attack."  "A car has driven into a group of people at a Christmas market in Germany," the AP wrote in its post on X.  As Breitbart News's Kurt Zindulka reported, a man, who is "reportedly from Saudi Arabia" drove a car through "a crowd of people at a Christmas market" in the city of Magdeburg.  The community notes for the AP's post on X explains:  "A car has driven" implies the car drove itself, which is factually incorrect. A man from Saudi Arabia intentionally drove the car into the Christmas market as a terror attack.  Several people responded to the AP's post on X, questioning "who was driving the car" and criticizing the establishment media for writing "headlines like this" instead of being honest.  "The media likes to write headlines like this because instead of being honest about the driver being a terrorist, they hope you may just think it's one of those evil Elon Musk self driving cars acting up again," another person wrote in a post on X.  "'A car has driven into a group of people' might be one of the best possible examples of how the media has worked tirelessly to ensure that its importance and influence collapse," Ian Miller, a writer with Outkick wrote.<br><b>Location:</b> Germany<br><b>Date:</b> 2024-12-21T03:19:02Z<br><b>Source:</b> Breitbart<br></div>`)[0];

In a post on X, the AP shared an article with the title, "At least 2 dead and 60 hurt after a car drives into a German Christmas market in a suspected attack."  "A car has driven into a group of people at a Christmas market in Germany," the AP wrote in its post on X.  As Breitbart News's Kurt Zindulka reported, a man, who is "reportedly from Saudi Arabia" drove a car through "a crowd of people at a Christmas market" in the city of Magdeburg.  The community notes for the AP's post on X explains:  "A car has driven" implies the car drove itself, which is factually incorrect. A man from Saudi Arabia intentionally drove the car into the Christmas market as a terror attack.  Several people responded to the AP's post on X, questioning "who was driving the car" and criticizing the establishment media for writing "headlines like this" instead of being honest.  "The media likes to write headlines like this because instead of being honest about the driver being a terrorist, they hope you may just think it's one of those evil Elon Musk self driving cars acting up again," another person wrote in a post on X.  "'A car has driven into a group of people' might be one of the best possible examples of how the media has worked tirelessly to ensure that its importance and influence collapse," Ian Miller, a writer with Outkick wrote.<br><b>Location:</b> Magdeburg<br><b>Date:</b> 2024-12-21T03:19:02Z<br><b>Source:</b> Breitbart<br></div>`)[0];

Following numerous allegations and charges against the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) over its ties to terrorists with involvement in the Hamas terrorist massacre in Israel, the scandal-hit agency is facing new allegations of wrongdoing.  U.N. Watch a Geneva-based NGO, has released parts of a 150-page dossier that Executive Director Hillel Neuer told Fox News Digital shows "high-level UNRWA staff who are complicit with terrorists, who meet with them regularly."  Before presenting his documentation to the world, Neuer attempted to address it directly with UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini. In a letter to Lazzarini, Neuer explained that Lazzarini's staff have previously complained that U.N. Watch did not submit its reports to UNRWA for comment prior to publishing. Neuer then recounted several attempts to meet personally with Lazzarini to discuss U.N. Watch's findings and explained that when it released its dossier, Lazzarini would be unable to "claim... that we do not show you the evidence in advance."  UN, ISRAEL AT ODDS OVER CAUSE OF DECLINE IN AID DELIVERIES: 'FALSE NARRATIVES BY INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY'  Neuer's group then released photographs of senior UNRWA staff, including Lazzarini and former UNRWA Commissioner-General Pierre Krahenbuhl, meeting with alleged terror leaders. "You wouldn't find these photos on [UNRWA officials'] own social media," he said. "We found them our own ways, but they don't post them."  Neuer pointed Fox News Digital to two undated photos showing Lazzarini meeting with groups that included members of terror organizations, including the Jihadi Islamic Movement, the Islamic Ansar League, and Hamas.  In another photo dating back to late 2014, multiple UNRWA regional directors met with senior Hamas member Ali Baraka. Neuer said, and reporting from Al Watan Voice confirms, that the UNRWA staff wanted to "to congratulate [Baraka] on Hamas' anniversary."  In another instance, Neuer said he was able to find a photo and transcript from a February 2017 meeting between former UNRWA chief Pierre Krahenbuhl, Baraka, members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), and others. According to U.N. Watch, Krahenbuhl reportedly told the assembly that "we are united, and no one can separate us."  In September 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice announced "terrorism, murder conspiracy, and sanctions-evasion charges" against Baraka and five other Hamas leaders for their roles in Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, terror attack, which killed 40 Americans and over 1,000 others.  UN ACCUSED OF DOWNPLAYING HAMAS TERRORISTS' USE OF GAZA HOSPITALS AS NEW REPORT IGNORES IMPORTANT DETAILS  Krahenbuhl and his staff were investigated in 2019 for reports of "sexual misconduct, nepotism, retaliation, discrimination and other abuses of authority." Krahenbuhl resigned from his position, but in April 2024 was named the head of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). Leading congressional voices requested that Secretary of State Antony Blinken and U.S. Agency for International Development Administrator Samantha Power "persuade the ICRC to reconsider this appointment" given Krahenbuhl's "disastrous tenure" as UNRWA commissioner-general.  Fox News Digital asked the ICRC about the photos of Krahenbuhl posing with terror leaders, and of congressional concern about his fitness for the position in the Red Cross. An spokesperson told Fox News Digital that the ICRC "was not present in the meeting, so it cannot speak to the full context of the discussion."  They also stated that Krahenbuhl "has demonstrated through his work at ICRC and his decades of humanitarian experience that he has one objective: to secure aid to civilians in conflict zones. Meeting with any group that controls access to civilians, is an essential part of the ICRC work and other humanitarian organizations in conflict zones."  U.N. Watch's latest dossier also includes interviews of UNRWA students taken by local Palestinian film crews over a period of three weeks during the summer of 2024. In one interview, a 14-year-old former student of UNRWA's Ein Arik co-ed school said that his school taught him "'to fight back and resist' so that 'Palestine will be liberated and our lands will return to us by the good grace of Allah.'" The child later explains that the solution for Jerusalem is to "kill the Jews. We get rid of the Jews."  A second NGO, IMPACT-se has reported extensively on educational materials used in UNRWA schools for over two decades. In a Nov. 13 report, IMPACT-se names 12 high-ranking UNRWA principals, deputies, directors or deputy directors of training centers who held membership in either Hamas or PIJ. The report notes that nine of the 12 participated in the terror attack of Oct. 7, with "some even serving as Nukhba operatives," members of the special forces units of Hamas. Two of the dual UNRWA- and Hamas-member principals headed schools "under which Hamas tunnels were built."  ISRAELI PARLIAMENT BANS UNRWA OVER TERRORISM TIES, FACES INTERNATIONAL BACKLASH  The latest IMPACT-se review complements findings from March 2023 that two UNRWA schools headed by Hamas members had "promote[d] violence and terrorism in self-created study material." Now, IMPACT-se has named three additional schools where Hamas operatives served as UNRWA staff. The NGO found that these schools promoted "libels against and non-recognition of Israel" and "gratuitously insert[ed] content promoting hatred and violence against Israel into grammar exercises."  IMPACT-se found that UNRWA schools are "shamelessly flout[ing]" UNESCO standards, which include "peace-building, respect for non-Palestinian groups, and avoiding incitement to violence."  The group's report cites intelligence claiming that "over 10% of the 510 [senior] employees in UNRWA's education system in the Gaza Strip," are members of PIJ or Hamas. UNRWA members are not allowed to be participants in terror groups designated by the U.N. Security Council. But as Neuer explained, "The U.N. terror list is one of the thinnest lists in the world," because "Russia and China can block any designation they don't like." Neuer said this means "there's virtually no Palestinian groups" on the list.  Fox News Digital reached out to UNRWA media officials on numerous occasions for its response to the contents of IMPACT-se's and U.N. Watch's dossiers, about allegations that UNRWA schools were not adhering to UNESCO standards, and about Lazzarini's refusal to meet with Neuer.  Bill Deere, director of the UNRWA representative office in Washington, told Fox News Digital, "UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini has cautioned the spread of disinformation against UNRWA," which he says "is meant to create chaos and divert attention from the political aims to dismantle the Agency." Reiterating the content of a statement Lazzarini shared on X in the aftermath of Neuer's dossier being released, Deere said, "UNRWA recommends before giving oxygen to accusations like these, double-check the source and question the intent to avoid becoming an echo chamber for disinformation and de facto the fueling of hate and putting other people's lives in danger."

Watch's interviews with UNRWA students, he said, "What they don't tell you is these children were filmed without the knowledge or permission of their parents," Deere said. "The kids were isolated and asked a series of leading questions designed to elicit a response. This is beyond misleading, it's twisted and desperate."  The U.S. was among numerous countries to pause support to UNRWA in January after the initial proofs emerged of members' participation in the terror attack of Oct. 7. Congress has halted funding to UNRWA through March 2025.<br><b>Location:</b> Geneva<br><b>Date:</b> 2024-12-08T16:25:30Z<br><b>Source:</b> Fox News<br></div>`)[0];
