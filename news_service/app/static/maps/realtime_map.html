The suspect, Abdullah Ezzeldin Taha Mohamed Hassan, was an Egyptian national living in Falls Church, Virginia, who instructed an FBI informant to carry out the attack, according to a criminal complaint filed on Monday.  Hassan ran several social media accounts that supported ISIS, al-Qaeda and Hamas, and advocated for violence against Jews, the FBI said in the complaint filed in a federal court in Virginia.  Local police located Hassan after receiving a tip about one of Hassan's accounts on X. An undercover FBI asset then connected with Hassan on social media and secure messaging apps.  Hassan allegedly instructed the informant on how to join ISIS and shared jihadist propaganda, including a video that advocated for killing Jews.  He encouraged the informant to carry out an attack, sending him instructions on how to create a "martyrdom video," the complaint said.  The suspect sent the informant bomb-making instructions and told the informant, who said he was in New York, to target a building representing Jews, later settling on the Israeli consulate. The bomb-making instructions allegedly included the suggestion that packing the explosive with 30 mm aluminum ball bearings, for shrapnel, "will do the trick."  Hassan told the informant how to surveil the consulate and how to escape to ISIS territory after the attack, and also suggested he could "lay havoc on them with an assault rifle" instead of a bomb. He also told the informant to livestream the attack so Hassan could give the footage to ISIS.  The conversations took place last month and this month, the complaint said.  Hassan, who according to a court filing was arrested on December 17, is accused of crimes related to distributing information on explosives and weapons of mass destruction.  Ofir Akunis, Israeli's consul-general in New York, thanked US security services for thwarting the planned attack.  "This attempted attack by terror organizations is an attack on the sovereign soil of the State of Israel in its entirety," Akunis said in a Thursday statement to The Times of Israel." "It's proof that terror knows no boundaries and that we must fight it everywhere and every time."  There was no immediate comment from the US Justice Department on the arrest.  Authorities have prevented other recent terror attacks against Jews in New York.  In September, a suspect was arrested in Canada while attempting to enter the US to attack a Jewish center in Brooklyn in support of ISIS.  And In July, a neo-Nazi was indicted for planning mass casualty attacks against Jews in New York City by distributing poisoned candy to Jewish children.<br><b>Location:</b> New York City<br><b>Date:</b> 2024-12-19T23:29:28Z<br><b>Source:</b> timesofisrael.com<br></div>`)[0];

The pro-Palestinian Bronx Anti-War Coalition, a self-described "working-class, BIPOC-led, anti-imperialist" group, organized a rally on Sunday in New York City's Union Square to express solidarity with the "Axis of Resistance," which the group identified as Hezbollah, Iran, Syria, Yemen, and the Iraqi "resistance."  At the event, a speaker donning a keffiyeh issued sharp proclamations, including: "Stop pointing fingers at each other. Our fingers, our pens, our rifles will be pointed at the U.S. government, the Zionist entity, and nobody else."  The rally featured chants repeated by the crowd, calling out "U.S. imperialists" as the "number one terrorists" and voicing unity with regional terror movements.  Participants were seen waving flags representing the Palestinians; Iran, the leading state sponsor of terror; Iraq, where Iranian-backed militias hold significant influence; Lebanon, home to Hezbollah; Syria under Assad's regime, notorious for brutal crackdowns during its civil war; and Yemen, where the Houthi rebels align with Iran.  These were seen alongside Hezbollah's yellow flag, a known emblem of armed resistance and Islamic terror.  Hezbollah, which has actively sought to expand its influence beyond the Middle East, is designated a terrorist organization by more than a dozen countries and international entities, including major Western nations, members of the European Union, and most Arab League member states, due to its involvement in terrorist activities against American, French, Israeli, and other targets.  Former President Donald Trump has denounced Hezbollah, stating, "No terrorist group other than al-Qaeda has more American blood on its hands." Meanwhile, Arkansas Republican Sen. Tom Cotton has called for the elimination of "all of Hezbollah's leadership" while insisting that the United States "should let Israel win" against Tehran's key terrorist proxy in the region.  The event also emphasized anti-sectarianism, with the speaker urging the crowd to "rise above religious differences" and focus on a shared cause.  The "anti-capitalism" Bronx Anti-War Coalition amplified their message on social media, sharing a video of Hamas spokesperson Abu Obeida denouncing sectarianism, as well as a speech by Hezbollah Secretary-General Naim Qassam streamed from Iran's Press TV.  In response, critics took to social media to express outrage over the rally's rhetoric.  "The day will come when these Palestine 'activists' inevitably execute a massive terror attack in NYC. And once they do, don't say we didn't warn you," wrote journalist Eitan Fischberger.  "Hey @RealTomHoman, here are some prime deportation candidates!" wrote conservative commentator Dave Rubin.  "It's never been about Israel, it's always been about destroying Western civilization," wrote activist Eyal Yakoby.  The matter comes as the trend of anti-American sentiment at pro-Palestinian events continues to grow.  According to world-renowned military historian and professor Dr. Victor Davis Hanson, Hamas's "death cult" relies on "useful Western idiots" to support the Palestinian cause, which has "fused with the leftwing DEI industry."  In addition, he predicted over a year ago that pro-Palestinian protests and support for Hamas in the U.S. have alienated many Americans and would all but ensure a tough conservative president in 2024.<br><b>Location:</b> New York City<br><b>Date:</b> 2024-12-18T03:40:36Z<br><b>Source:</b> Breitbart<br></div>`)[0];

The pro-Palestinian Bronx Anti-War Coalition, a self-described "working-class, BIPOC-led, anti-imperialist" group, organized a rally on Sunday in New York City's Union Square to express solidarity with the "Axis of Resistance," which the group identified as Hezbollah, Iran, Syria, Yemen, and the Iraqi "resistance."  At the event, a speaker donning a keffiyeh issued sharp proclamations, including: "Stop pointing fingers at each other. Our fingers, our pens, our rifles will be pointed at the U.S. government, the Zionist entity, and nobody else."  The rally featured chants repeated by the crowd, calling out "U.S. imperialists" as the "number one terrorists" and voicing unity with regional terror movements.  Participants were seen waving flags representing the Palestinians; Iran, the leading state sponsor of terror; Iraq, where Iranian-backed militias hold significant influence; Lebanon, home to Hezbollah; Syria under Assad's regime, notorious for brutal crackdowns during its civil war; and Yemen, where the Houthi rebels align with Iran.  These were seen alongside Hezbollah's yellow flag, a known emblem of armed resistance and Islamic terror.  Hezbollah, which has actively sought to expand its influence beyond the Middle East, is designated a terrorist organization by more than a dozen countries and international entities, including major Western nations, members of the European Union, and most Arab League member states, due to its involvement in terrorist activities against American, French, Israeli, and other targets.  Former President Donald Trump has denounced Hezbollah, stating, "No terrorist group other than al-Qaeda has more American blood on its hands." Meanwhile, Arkansas Republican Sen. Tom Cotton has called for the elimination of "all of Hezbollah's leadership" while insisting that the United States "should let Israel win" against Tehran's key terrorist proxy in the region.  The event also emphasized anti-sectarianism, with the speaker urging the crowd to "rise above religious differences" and focus on a shared cause.  The "anti-capitalism" Bronx Anti-War Coalition amplified their message on social media, sharing a video of Hamas spokesperson Abu Obeida denouncing sectarianism, as well as a speech by Hezbollah Secretary-General Naim Qassam streamed from Iran's Press TV.  In response, critics took to social media to express outrage over the rally's rhetoric.  "The day will come when these Palestine 'activists' inevitably execute a massive terror attack in NYC.

"It's never been about Israel, it's always been about destroying Western civilization," wrote activist Eyal Yakoby.  The matter comes as the trend of anti-American sentiment at pro-Palestinian events continues to grow.

Following numerous allegations and charges against the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) over its ties to terrorists with involvement in the Hamas terrorist massacre in Israel, the scandal-hit agency is facing new allegations of wrongdoing.  U.N. Watch a Geneva-based NGO, has released parts of a 150-page dossier that Executive Director Hillel Neuer told Fox News Digital shows "high-level UNRWA staff who are complicit with terrorists, who meet with them regularly."  Before presenting his documentation to the world, Neuer attempted to address it directly with UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini. In a letter to Lazzarini, Neuer explained that Lazzarini's staff have previously complained that U.N. Watch did not submit its reports to UNRWA for comment prior to publishing. Neuer then recounted several attempts to meet personally with Lazzarini to discuss U.N. Watch's findings and explained that when it released its dossier, Lazzarini would be unable to "claim... that we do not show you the evidence in advance."  UN, ISRAEL AT ODDS OVER CAUSE OF DECLINE IN AID DELIVERIES: 'FALSE NARRATIVES BY INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY'  Neuer's group then released photographs of senior UNRWA staff, including Lazzarini and former UNRWA Commissioner-General Pierre Krahenbuhl, meeting with alleged terror leaders. "You wouldn't find these photos on [UNRWA officials'] own social media," he said. "We found them our own ways, but they don't post them."  Neuer pointed Fox News Digital to two undated photos showing Lazzarini meeting with groups that included members of terror organizations, including the Jihadi Islamic Movement, the Islamic Ansar League, and Hamas.  In another photo dating back to late 2014, multiple UNRWA regional directors met with senior Hamas member Ali Baraka. Neuer said, and reporting from Al Watan Voice confirms, that the UNRWA staff wanted to "to congratulate [Baraka] on Hamas' anniversary."  In another instance, Neuer said he was able to find a photo and transcript from a February 2017 meeting between former UNRWA chief Pierre Krahenbuhl, Baraka, members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), and others. According to U.N. Watch, Krahenbuhl reportedly told the assembly that "we are united, and no one can separate us."  In September 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice announced "terrorism, murder conspiracy, and sanctions-evasion charges" against Baraka and five other Hamas leaders for their roles in Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, terror attack, which killed 40 Americans and over 1,000 others.  UN ACCUSED OF DOWNPLAYING HAMAS TERRORISTS' USE OF GAZA HOSPITALS AS NEW REPORT IGNORES IMPORTANT DETAILS  Krahenbuhl and his staff were investigated in 2019 for reports of "sexual misconduct, nepotism, retaliation, discrimination and other abuses of authority." Krahenbuhl resigned from his position, but in April 2024 was named the head of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). Leading congressional voices requested that Secretary of State Antony Blinken and U.S. Agency for International Development Administrator Samantha Power "persuade the ICRC to reconsider this appointment" given Krahenbuhl's "disastrous tenure" as UNRWA commissioner-general.  Fox News Digital asked the ICRC about the photos of Krahenbuhl posing with terror leaders, and of congressional concern about his fitness for the position in the Red Cross. An spokesperson told Fox News Digital that the ICRC "was not present in the meeting, so it cannot speak to the full context of the discussion."  They also stated that Krahenbuhl "has demonstrated through his work at ICRC and his decades of humanitarian experience that he has one objective: to secure aid to civilians in conflict zones. Meeting with any group that controls access to civilians, is an essential part of the ICRC work and other humanitarian organizations in conflict zones."  U.N. Watch's latest dossier also includes interviews of UNRWA students taken by local Palestinian film crews over a period of three weeks during the summer of 2024. In one interview, a 14-year-old former student of UNRWA's Ein Arik co-ed school said that his school taught him "'to fight back and resist' so that 'Palestine will be liberated and our lands will return to us by the good grace of Allah.'" The child later explains that the solution for Jerusalem is to "kill the Jews. We get rid of the Jews."  A second NGO, IMPACT-se has reported extensively on educational materials used in UNRWA schools for over two decades. In a Nov. 13 report, IMPACT-se names 12 high-ranking UNRWA principals, deputies, directors or deputy directors of training centers who held membership in either Hamas or PIJ. The report notes that nine of the 12 participated in the terror attack of Oct. 7, with "some even serving as Nukhba operatives," members of the special forces units of Hamas. Two of the dual UNRWA- and Hamas-member principals headed schools "under which Hamas tunnels were built."  ISRAELI PARLIAMENT BANS UNRWA OVER TERRORISM TIES, FACES INTERNATIONAL BACKLASH  The latest IMPACT-se review complements findings from March 2023 that two UNRWA schools headed by Hamas members had "promote[d] violence and terrorism in self-created study material." Now, IMPACT-se has named three additional schools where Hamas operatives served as UNRWA staff. The NGO found that these schools promoted "libels against and non-recognition of Israel" and "gratuitously insert[ed] content promoting hatred and violence against Israel into grammar exercises."  IMPACT-se found that UNRWA schools are "shamelessly flout[ing]" UNESCO standards, which include "peace-building, respect for non-Palestinian groups, and avoiding incitement to violence."  The group's report cites intelligence claiming that "over 10% of the 510 [senior] employees in UNRWA's education system in the Gaza Strip," are members of PIJ or Hamas. UNRWA members are not allowed to be participants in terror groups designated by the U.N. Security Council. But as Neuer explained, "The U.N. terror list is one of the thinnest lists in the world," because "Russia and China can block any designation they don't like." Neuer said this means "there's virtually no Palestinian groups" on the list.  Fox News Digital reached out to UNRWA media officials on numerous occasions for its response to the contents of IMPACT-se's and U.N. Watch's dossiers, about allegations that UNRWA schools were not adhering to UNESCO standards, and about Lazzarini's refusal to meet with Neuer.  Bill Deere, director of the UNRWA representative office in Washington, told Fox News Digital, "UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini has cautioned the spread of disinformation against UNRWA," which he says "is meant to create chaos and divert attention from the political aims to dismantle the Agency." Reiterating the content of a statement Lazzarini shared on X in the aftermath of Neuer's dossier being released, Deere said, "UNRWA recommends before giving oxygen to accusations like these, double-check the source and question the intent to avoid becoming an echo chamber for disinformation and de facto the fueling of hate and putting other people's lives in danger."

Following numerous allegations and charges against the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) over its ties to terrorists with involvement in the Hamas terrorist massacre in Israel, the scandal-hit agency is facing new allegations of wrongdoing.  U.N. Watch a Geneva-based NGO, has released parts of a 150-page dossier that Executive Director Hillel Neuer told Fox News Digital shows "high-level UNRWA staff who are complicit with terrorists, who meet with them regularly."  Before presenting his documentation to the world, Neuer attempted to address it directly with UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini. In a letter to Lazzarini, Neuer explained that Lazzarini's staff have previously complained that U.N. Watch did not submit its reports to UNRWA for comment prior to publishing. Neuer then recounted several attempts to meet personally with Lazzarini to discuss U.N. Watch's findings and explained that when it released its dossier, Lazzarini would be unable to "claim... that we do not show you the evidence in advance."  UN, ISRAEL AT ODDS OVER CAUSE OF DECLINE IN AID DELIVERIES: 'FALSE NARRATIVES BY INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY'  Neuer's group then released photographs of senior UNRWA staff, including Lazzarini and former UNRWA Commissioner-General Pierre Krahenbuhl, meeting with alleged terror leaders. "You wouldn't find these photos on [UNRWA officials'] own social media," he said. "We found them our own ways, but they don't post them."  Neuer pointed Fox News Digital to two undated photos showing Lazzarini meeting with groups that included members of terror organizations, including the Jihadi Islamic Movement, the Islamic Ansar League, and Hamas.  In another photo dating back to late 2014, multiple UNRWA regional directors met with senior Hamas member Ali Baraka. Neuer said, and reporting from Al Watan Voice confirms, that the UNRWA staff wanted to "to congratulate [Baraka] on Hamas' anniversary."  In another instance, Neuer said he was able to find a photo and transcript from a February 2017 meeting between former UNRWA chief Pierre Krahenbuhl, Baraka, members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), and others. According to U.N. Watch, Krahenbuhl reportedly told the assembly that "we are united, and no one can separate us."  In September 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice announced "terrorism, murder conspiracy, and sanctions-evasion charges" against Baraka and five other Hamas leaders for their roles in Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, terror attack, which killed 40 Americans and over 1,000 others.  UN ACCUSED OF DOWNPLAYING HAMAS TERRORISTS' USE OF GAZA HOSPITALS AS NEW REPORT IGNORES IMPORTANT DETAILS  Krahenbuhl and his staff were investigated in 2019 for reports of "sexual misconduct, nepotism, retaliation, discrimination and other abuses of authority." Krahenbuhl resigned from his position, but in April 2024 was named the head of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). Leading congressional voices requested that Secretary of State Antony Blinken and U.S. Agency for International Development Administrator Samantha Power "persuade the ICRC to reconsider this appointment" given Krahenbuhl's "disastrous tenure" as UNRWA commissioner-general.  Fox News Digital asked the ICRC about the photos of Krahenbuhl posing with terror leaders, and of congressional concern about his fitness for the position in the Red Cross. An spokesperson told Fox News Digital that the ICRC "was not present in the meeting, so it cannot speak to the full context of the discussion."  They also stated that Krahenbuhl "has demonstrated through his work at ICRC and his decades of humanitarian experience that he has one objective: to secure aid to civilians in conflict zones. Meeting with any group that controls access to civilians, is an essential part of the ICRC work and other humanitarian organizations in conflict zones."  U.N. Watch's latest dossier also includes interviews of UNRWA students taken by local Palestinian film crews over a period of three weeks during the summer of 2024. In one interview, a 14-year-old former student of UNRWA's Ein Arik co-ed school said that his school taught him "'to fight back and resist' so that 'Palestine will be liberated and our lands will return to us by the good grace of Allah.'" The child later explains that the solution for Jerusalem is to "kill the Jews. We get rid of the Jews."  A second NGO, IMPACT-se has reported extensively on educational materials used in UNRWA schools for over two decades. In a Nov. 13 report, IMPACT-se names 12 high-ranking UNRWA principals, deputies, directors or deputy directors of training centers who held membership in either Hamas or PIJ. The report notes that nine of the 12 participated in the terror attack of Oct. 7, with "some even serving as Nukhba operatives," members of the special forces units of Hamas. Two of the dual UNRWA- and Hamas-member principals headed schools "under which Hamas tunnels were built."  ISRAELI PARLIAMENT BANS UNRWA OVER TERRORISM TIES, FACES INTERNATIONAL BACKLASH  The latest IMPACT-se review complements findings from March 2023 that two UNRWA schools headed by Hamas members had "promote[d] violence and terrorism in self-created study material." Now, IMPACT-se has named three additional schools where Hamas operatives served as UNRWA staff. The NGO found that these schools promoted "libels against and non-recognition of Israel" and "gratuitously insert[ed] content promoting hatred and violence against Israel into grammar exercises."  IMPACT-se found that UNRWA schools are "shamelessly flout[ing]" UNESCO standards, which include "peace-building, respect for non-Palestinian groups, and avoiding incitement to violence."  The group's report cites intelligence claiming that "over 10% of the 510 [senior] employees in UNRWA's education system in the Gaza Strip," are members of PIJ or Hamas. UNRWA members are not allowed to be participants in terror groups designated by the U.N. Security Council. But as Neuer explained, "The U.N. terror list is one of the thinnest lists in the world," because "Russia and China can block any designation they don't like." Neuer said this means "there's virtually no Palestinian groups" on the list.  Fox News Digital reached out to UNRWA media officials on numerous occasions for its response to the contents of IMPACT-se's and U.N. Watch's dossiers, about allegations that UNRWA schools were not adhering to UNESCO standards, and about Lazzarini's refusal to meet with Neuer.  Bill Deere, director of the UNRWA representative office in Washington, told Fox News Digital, "UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini has cautioned the spread of disinformation against UNRWA," which he says "is meant to create chaos and divert attention from the political aims to dismantle the Agency."

Israel Hayom reported Sunday:  A senior Hamas official currently based in Turkey told Saudi media that the 37th anniversary of the terrorist organization's founding comes during a period of decline due to defeats in Gaza and the broader region.  The official disclosed, "Hamas is suffering from a genuine leadership crisis. The Al-Aqsa Flood attack backfired on us, submerging us in a sea of blood and crises. The most recent blow was the fall of Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria, with which Hamas had been attempting to rebuild relations."  According to a report by the Saudi news site Elaph, the Syrian government has ordered Palestinian terrorist groups to shut down their offices, hand over their weapons, dismantle training camps, and leave Syria as soon as possible. The primary Palestinian group active in Syria has been the Islamic Jihad. In contrast, Hamas's political bureau left Syria earlier due to its support for Islamist rebels at the start of the Syrian civil war, which sparked a rift with Assad.  Israel Hayom also cited reporting that Palestinian terrorists in Syria fled to Iran, but may leave for other countries due to the fear of assassination (Israel is suspected of having killed Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in July.)  There are also Hamas officials in Turkey, and some are in Qatar -- including some who reportedly returned there at the urging of the incoming Trump administration, solely for the purpose of negotiating a hotage deal by January 20.  The report that Hamas leaders are accepting that the October 7 terror attack was a strategic mistake is a reversal from past months, and suggests that Israel is succeeding in restoring a deterrent against its enemies.

Israel Hayom reported Sunday:  A senior Hamas official currently based in Turkey told Saudi media that the 37th anniversary of the terrorist organization's founding comes during a period of decline due to defeats in Gaza and the broader region.  The official disclosed, "Hamas is suffering from a genuine leadership crisis. The Al-Aqsa Flood attack backfired on us, submerging us in a sea of blood and crises. The most recent blow was the fall of Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria, with which Hamas had been attempting to rebuild relations."  According to a report by the Saudi news site Elaph, the Syrian government has ordered Palestinian terrorist groups to shut down their offices, hand over their weapons, dismantle training camps, and leave Syria as soon as possible. The primary Palestinian group active in Syria has been the Islamic Jihad. In contrast, Hamas's political bureau left Syria earlier due to its support for Islamist rebels at the start of the Syrian civil war, which sparked a rift with Assad.  Israel Hayom also cited reporting that Palestinian terrorists in Syria fled to Iran, but may leave for other countries due to the fear of assassination (Israel is suspected of having killed Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in July.)  There are also Hamas officials in Turkey, and some are in Qatar -- including some who reportedly returned there at the urging of the incoming Trump administration, solely for the purpose of negotiating a hotage deal by January 20.  The report that Hamas leaders are accepting that the October 7 terror attack was a strategic mistake is a reversal from past months, and suggests that Israel is succeeding in restoring a deterrent against its enemies.  However, there are European nations who continue to reward Hamas, with Ireland the latest to join South Africa's "genocide" case against Israel at the International Court of Justice. Ireland, Spain, and Norway also recognized a Palestinian state.<br><b>Location:</b> Ireland<br><b>Date:</b> 2024-12-15T19:03:02Z<br><b>Source:</b> Breitbart<br></div>`)[0];

(Credit: KWTX)  At least five people were injured, and a suspect was killed, after a man drove his pickup truck through the glass doors of a J.C. Penney in a mall in Texas, police said.  The incident happened on Saturday evening, just days before Christmas, at the Killeen Mall in Killeen, Texas - which is about 70 miles north of Austin.  In a press conference on Saturday evening, Texas Department of Public Safety Sgt. Bryan Washko said that the truck was driven "several hundred yards" through the entrance of the J.C. Penney store.  Startled shoppers were injured as the driver was "actively running people over" and a fifth went to the hospital on their own, Sergeant Washko said. Those injured ranged from 6 to 75 years old, he said.  5 DEAD, MANY INJURED AFTER MAN DRIVES INTO GERMAN CHRISTMAS MARKET IN SUSPECTED TERROR ATTACK: REPORT  WATCH:  The incident unfolded as authorities noticed that the suspect, who has not been identified, was seen "driving erratically," and police attempted to pull him over.

Six GOP-led House committees declared in a joint report that "antisemitism has been allowed to fester unchecked" due to "a disturbing pattern of defensiveness and denial," according to a copy exclusively obtained by The Post.  "Across the nation, Jewish Americans have been harassed, assaulted, intimidated, and subjected to hostile environments -- violations that stand in stark contrast to America's fundamental values, including a foundational commitment to religious freedom for all," the 42-page report says.  "The failure of our federal government departments and agencies is astounding."  The outpouring of anti-Israel and anti-Jewish remarks and actions tested America's free speech precepts and the fact that hate speech is generally lawful in the United States, unless it amounts to harassment or is an aggravating factor in a criminal act such as assault.  The Republican-led report points out, however, that federal law generally prevents recipients of taxpayer funds from tolerating discrimination -- allowing a foothold to leverage recipients to stiffen policies on campuses and at medical settings should federal officials so choose.  In almost every case, institutions allegedly took almost no disciplinary action against alleged antisemites and made no changes to codes of conduct, and faced no loss of grants to stop the rapidly spreading Jew hatred.  The report focuses heavily on Columbia University and its recommendations urge federal agencies to use money to incentivize more stringent anti-discrimination policies -- and also proposes potential legislation to that effect.  "The executive branch should aggressively enforce Title VI [anti-discrimination rules] and hold schools accountable for their failures to protect students. Universities that fail to fulfill the obligations upon which their federal funding is predicated or whose actions make clear they are unfit stewards of taxpayer  dollars should be treated accordingly," the Republican panels said.  High-profile reports of antisemitism -- mirrored by anti-Palestinian incidents that also occurred, especially during rallies and counter-rallies over the Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip -- was just the tip of the iceberg, according to the investigation.  In one alarming incident, a student overheard two health care providers at Columbia's medical school discussing whether or not to "treat her because she was Israeli."  "She sat in the room for another 10 minutes until someone finally came to address her health needs As of mid-December 2024, representatives of Columbia University have not provided any information to the Committees as a part of this investigation beyond an October 2, 2024, response of basic platitudes."  The Ivy League school, which was the site of a large encampment that featured on its fringes multiple documented instances of anti-Jewish remarks against pro-Israel activists and Jewish students, also reneged on a vow to punish students accused of breaking the rules to protest against Israel.  "Columbia said the 22 students arrested for the criminal takeover of Hamilton Hall would face expulsion. Instead, the University lifted the students' interim suspensions after pushback from radical faculty, allowing 7 to graduate, restoring 11 to good standing, and leaving 3 with preexisting sanctions suspended and 1 on probation," the report said.  "Despite dozens of students being arrested for conduct related to Hamilton Hall and the encampment,  or having faced discipline for other egregious antisemitic incidents; Columbia failed to expel students and issued final suspensions to only four students."  Some of the anti-Israel protesters at Columbia were themselves Jewish and argued that the protest was not pervasively antisemitic -- despite reported instances.  The document says that, unexpectedly, "many colleges handed down disparate disciplinary actions for Jewish students versus their antagonists -- the students who engaged in antisemitic behavior, encampments, and intimidating tactics such as campus checkpoints and tax-exempt organizations that enabled and funded violent campus protests."  Columbia, for example, "allowed a false narrative that Jewish students had perpetrated a 'chemical attack' at an anti-Israel rally to persist for months despite knowing it was false and that the students involved had merely sprayed novelty 'fart sprays.'  "In an apparent case of disparate treatment, the Jewish students responsible were given excessive year-and-a-half long suspensions, substantially longer than any suspension for antisemitic conduct violations," the report says.  "Columbia failed to correct the record despite requests from the Jewish community, even as anti-Israel students used the false narrative of a 'chemical attack' purportedly involving military-grade 'skunk spray' to demonize Jewish students and call for excluding Israelis.  "Columbia finally acknowledged that the incident was not a 'chemical attack' in August 2024, pursuant to a settlement with one of the Jewish students excessively disciplined, which also awarded the student $395,000 and modified the suspension to conditional disciplinary probation."  Allegedly biased institutions such as Columbia University, the University of Southern California, UCLA, George Washington University, Harvard University, and Yale University pocketed $2.7 billion in federal funds just in fiscal year 2023, which concluded right before Hamas terrorists invaded the Jewish state and killed more than 1,200 people -- including 33 Americans, the report says.  The probe, which was launched after House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) and other Republicans took a tour of the anti-Israel encampment at Columbia, touched on many federal agencies.  The State Department and Department of Homeland Security allegedly stonewalled records requests about the visa statuses of those harassing Jewish students with terror-infused tirades -- or else discovered that government money was being funneled to tax-exempt charities  "Rather than confronting the severity of the problem, many institutions have dismissed congressional and public criticism and abdicated responsibility for the hostile environments they have enabled," the report states.  "This refusal to acknowledge or address the issue has allowed antisemitism to take root and thrive in spaces that contravene the values of this great nation."<br><b>Location:</b> Columbia University<br><b>Date:</b> 2024-12-19T13:04:29Z<br><b>Source:</b> New York Post<br></div>`)[0];

So far, the group, Betar, has about 30 names of students from nations such as Jordan, Syria, Egypt, Canada, and the United Kingdom currently enrolled in some of the nation's top universities, including Columbia, UPenn, Michigan, Syracuse, UCLA, The New School for Social Research, Carnegie Mellon, and George Washington University.  "We have started commencing lists of Jew-hating foreign nationals on visas who support Hamas," said Ross Glick, director of the US chapter of Betar.  Betar has IDed the haters using a combination of facial recognition software and "relationship database technology" to weed out people who were busted at antisemitic campus protests over the last year.  "One of our issues is processing power, there is just so much video to work through," Glick said.  Betar is already in contact with "prospective" Trump administration appointees in the Justice Department about how best to take action on those identified, Glick said.  Among those on the list is Momodou Taal, a British national and PhD candidate in Africana studies at Cornell University, who was suspended twice for participating in a pair of on-campus Palestinian protests, most recently in September. University officials initially told Taal that the latest incident would lead to his F-1 visa being revoked, Newsweek reported. The Ivy later backed down.  Weeks after the Oct. 7 Hamas terror attack in Israel, Trump vowed to deport foreign students who chanted in support of radical Islamic terrorism. He reiterated that promise to donors in May.  "When I am president we will not allow our colleges to be taken over by violent radicals. If you come from another country and try to bring jihadism or anti-Americanism or anti-Semitism to our campuses we will immediately deport you. You'll be out of that school," Trump said at a rally that same month.  Said Glick: "We are strongly supportive of the Trump Administration's plan to deport jihadis who seek to destroy America. Our campuses and our streets are filled with violent people who hate Jews and cannot co-exist with Western society."  On Wednesday, Glick was on Capitol Hill meeting with lawmakers including pro-Israel Sen. John Fetterman (D-PA). Glick was in town to protest a Senate vote on whether to initiate an arms embargo against Israel.  Glick also met with aids to Republican Sens. Ted Cruz and James Lankford.  "They all gave me the thumbs up and told me how to follow up," Glick said.  On the legislative front, Staten Island Rep. Nicole Malliotakis introduced a bill in February -- the No Visas for Anti-Semitic Students Act -- that would "revoke the visas of students who have engaged in antisemitic activities."  "Entering our country to attend one of our esteemed universities is a privilege, and foreign students who conduct antisemitic activity on our campuses should have their visas revoked," Malliotakis said. "I'm pleased the Trump Administration plans to take immediate action to have these individuals removed."  Betar doesn't shy away from controversy.  The organization is banned from Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp because of a joke it made about handing out beepers to members of a pro-Palestine group at the University of Pittsburgh, referring to Israel's targeted beeper bomb attack against Hezbollah terrorists in Lebanon.  The group takes its name from Betar fortress, a prominent location in the Jewish-Roman wars of the second century. Betar was founded in 1923 by Ze'ev Jabotinsky, a prominent early Zionist leader.<br><b>Location:</b> United States<br><b>Date:</b> 2024-11-23T13:26:52Z<br><b>Source:</b> New York Post<br></div>`)[0];

Instead, they fought "the most intense combat engagement by a U.S. Navy warship since World War II."  The crew of the USS Carney thought they were headed for a normal deployment, and by "normal," at least some of the crew was thinking about fun off the boat. At least that's what Fire Controlman 2nd Class Kameron Miller, a Mk. 160 gun console technician on his first deployment, was thinking.  "I've only heard stories, but I expected to pull into ports and party a little bit," said Miller. "That was not quite the case."  It was not.  Miller and the Carney left Naval Station Mayport, Florida on Sept. 27. On Oct. 7, just as the crew was arriving in the Red Sea for duty with the 5th Fleet, Hamas fighters invaded Israel in a massive terror attack, killing over 1,000. Within days, the Carney was on the front line of a rapidly escalating combat.  "The XO told us flat out what the situation was, and what we could be facing," said Gunner's Mate 1st Class Charles Currie, a Mk. 45 gun technician. "At that point the crew just started to get ready."  Houthi rebels in Yemen, backed by Iranian hardware, began firing missiles and drones at civilian merchant ships in the Red Sea, in an attempt to choke the vital trade route. The Carney quickly found itself as the primary U.S. Navy ship standing in the way.  On October 19, the Houthis took aim at the Carney.  The Navy released new details this week of that fight, including comments from crew members like Miller who found their expectations of placid duty and fun port calls swept away by a cruise that, when finished, faced 51 engagements.  The Oct. 19 battle began so unexpectedly that one crew member was initially confused by the ship-wide announcement.  "We were in berthing and heard [an announcement over the ship's 1MC intercom system] 'clear the weatherdecks,' and I remember thinking, 'what does that mean? I've never heard that before,'" said Fire Controlman (AEGIS) 2nd Class Justin Parker, a SPY radar technician assigned to Carney.  Immediately after the announcement, Parker heard the sound of missiles being fired off the ship, as well as the destroyer's main 5-inch guns. All aboard understood what it meant -- there were no scheduled live fire drills.  "We had never done anything like this before -- we had only trained to it," recalled Currie. "There was a lot of adrenaline going on. This was real-world now."  The Carney is an Arleigh Burke-class destroyer, the Navy's primary class of ships tasked with protecting fleets from air attack. With a crew of over 300, the ship is armed with machine guns, 5-inch cannons and as many as 90 anti-aircraft missiles, along with separate suites of weapons for anti-ship and anti-submarine operations.  By the end of what became a 10-hour standoff, Carney had shot down 15 drones and four land-attack cruise missiles, an engagement the Navy called "the most intense combat engagement by a U.S. Navy warship since World War II."  As the fight began and the ship defended itself, sailors said they remained calm.  "As nervous as you get, it's not about you," said Ensign William Hinckley, the ship's legal officer. "It's about keeping everybody else safe. Thinking about everybody else and not just yourself is crucial."  Over the next five months, the Carney engaged a threat no U.S. ship had faced before: Anti-Ship Ballistic Missiles, massive rockets fired designed specifically to sink ships like the Carney.  "The Houthis are the first entity in the history of the world to use anti-ship ballistic missiles ever," Vice Adm. Brad Cooper told 60 Minutes in February. "No one has ever used an anti-ship ballistic missile certainly against commercial shipping, much less against U.S. Navy ships."  F/A-18 Super Hornets and E/A-18 Growlers from the USS Eisenhower also engaged the ASBM, but the crew of the Carney faced them knowing they were the target.  "The ASBM threat is very challenging. It's very dynamic and it's very fast," said Cmdr. Jeremy Robertson, commanding officer of USS Carney in May. "Because of that, we have to have 100% confidence in my [Tactical Action Officers] and all of the watch teams and all of the systems that we have that are designed to detect that and make sure that the ship is protecting itself."  On Dec. 16, the Carney took out another 14 drones, according to reporting in The War Zone.  Lt. j.g. Haven Vickers, the anti-submarine warfare officer assigned to the Carney, said the crew knew what to do. "Every single training experience we did before deployment - that's what we fell back on," Vickers said.  The Carney returned to Florida in May. Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Lisa Franchetti awarded the ship the Combat Action Ribbon (CAR), the first time a Navy crew has received the decoration since 1991 in the Gulf War.  "I could not be more proud of what the Carney team has done since September," said Franchetti. "It has been eye-watering to watch; you truly are America's Warfighting Navy in action."  "It was probably one of the most rewarding experiences I'll ever have in my entire life," said Miller. "It wasn't just about traveling the world; it was about saving people's lives and getting a job done."<br><b>Location:</b> Red Sea<br><b>Date:</b> 2024-12-06T20:14:49Z<br><b>Source:</b> Task & Purpose<br></div>`)[0];

On Nov. 7, an anti-Israel mob set out on a "Jew hunt" through the streets of Amsterdam following a soccer game against a visiting Israeli team in what Israeli President Isaac Herzog termed an 'antisemitic pogrom.'  When the angry mob was done hunting down and violently assaulting Jews and Israelis, five victims were hospitalized. Rioters continued to protest following the attacks setting a tram aflame on Nov. 11 and intensifying the spotlight on antisemitism throughout Europe.  Rabbi Abraham Cooper, Associate Dean and Director of Global Social Action for the Simon Wiesenthal Center, told Fox News Digital that his organization "put a travel advisory on Amsterdam in the immediate aftermath of what happened." Cooper explained that the Simon Wiesenthal Center only takes this action "very rarely" and after serious deliberation.  TRAM SET ON FIRE AS AMSTERDAM RIOTS RAGE ON  "Theoretically," Cooper added, "you can slap a travel advisory on almost every place in Western Europe." As Cooper explained, "the establishment has never stepped forward in any really major way across Europe to safeguard their Jews and guarantee their rights and their religious freedoms."  Following Hamas' Oct. 7 terror attack on Israel, there has been a staggering increase in antisemitism across Europe. In May, citing data from the World Zionist Organization, Ynetnews reported an 800% increase in antisemitic incidents in Sweden over the previous year, as well as a 680% increase in Spain, a 450% increase in the Netherlands, a 442% increase in the UK and a 433% increase in France.  Events in Amsterdam appeared to be a flashpoint for further hate. On Nov. 10, Belgian authorities arrested five individuals after calls appeared on social media for a "Jew Hunt" in the Jewish Quarter of Antwerp, according to the Jerusalem Post.  In Greece in mid-November, protests featuring pro-Palestinian activists became so volatile that the Israeli Foreign Affairs Ministry advised Israelis to avoid the Embassy and certain other areas and to remove identifying symbols, the Jerusalem Post reported. Far from the first anti-Israel demonstration in Greece, in June, nine Europeans were under consideration for deportation following "disruptive anti-Israel demonstrations" at the University of Athens School of Law.  NETANYAHU CONDEMNS ANTISEMITIC POGROM IN AMSTERDAM, WARNS WORLD LEADERS ATTACKS WILL SPREAD IF DON'T ACT  The Jerusalem Post reported that an under-17 youth soccer team in Berlin was "chased and assaulted" on Nov. 7 by a knife- and stick-wielding crowd screaming, "Free Palestine." The Times of Israel reported that fewer than two weeks later, the Berlin Chief of Police told Jewish and gay residents to "be careful" in neighborhoods with high populations of Arabs. "Unfortunately, there are certain neighborhoods where there are mostly Arab people who also have sympathy for terrorist groups," she explained.  The expansion of at-risk groups in Berlin echoes the warning words of Holocaust survivor Simon Wiesenthal. As Cooper explained, his organization's founder readily emphasized, "It often starts with the Jews. It never ends with the Jews."  In the atmosphere of tension and hate, Cooper noted that Jewish Europeans are engaging in "conditioning and self-censorship," removing yarmulkes, or taking the Jewish "chai" symbols from their necklaces. Cooper said that it has "probably been about 15 years since a Jewish person felt comfortable walking to synagogue wearing a kippah in Amsterdam."  Cooper's concerns are borne out by media reports. As one Dutch Jewish citizen told Ynetnews, Jews visiting the Netherlands should not wear identifying items or "bring Israeli passports." The Times reported in October that many Irish Jews are likewise removing identifying symbols due to an environment of mistrust.  In France, Jewish citizens are removing mezuzahs from their doors, avoiding riding in Ubers, and even changing their names to protect themselves from being identified and targeted with hate when they receive deliveries, according to the Christian Science Monitor. In 2023, France recorded 1,676 antisemitic incidents, compared with 436 the prior year. About 1,200 French Jews began applications to emigrate to Israel in 2023, an increase of 430% from 2022.  ADDRESSING ANTISEMITISM SHOULD BE PRIORITY FOR EUROPE BEFORE RECOGNIZING PALESTINIAN STATE, LEADING RABBI SAYS  As Cooper explained, it is "enormously painful to look across Europe and to see that they give their due deference one or two days a year to dead Jews. They still haven't figured out in Europe how to live and embrace and celebrate Jewish presence in their societies."  With increased hate in Europe possibly impacting Americans traveling overseas, Fox News Digital asked the U.S. State Department whether it would issue travel advisories warning Jewish Americans of antisemitism abroad.  "We take seriously our commitment to provide U.S. citizens with clear, timely, and reliable information about every country in the world so they can make informed travel decisions," a spokesperson said. "We use standard formats for our Travel Advisories and Alerts to help U.S. citizens find and use important security information easily. We encourage U.S. citizens traveling overseas to enroll in the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP.state.gov) to receive important safety and security updates, and to make it easier for the U.S. embassy or consulate to contact them in an emergency."  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  The Netherlands' Level-Two State Department Travel Advisory, last updated in August, notes threats of terrorism, but provides no information about antisemitic hatred. Neither do advisories for France, the United Kingdom, Germany, Belgium, or Greece.  Cooper emphasized that the Simon Wiesenthal Center hopes the incoming Trump administration will "take the fight against antisemitism globally to a new level," making it "part and parcel of American foreign policy, especially in the Americas and in the international organizations for which we fork out billions of dollars every year."<br><b>Location:</b> Amsterdam<br><b>Date:</b> 2024-11-24T09:14:41Z<br><b>Source:</b> Fox News<br></div>`)[0];

Drone Mystery Could Be Covert Operation Searching For Device<br><b>Event body:</b> Globalists desperate to disrupt Trump peace negotiations ahead of inauguration.  According multiple Infowars sources as well as whistleblowers posting online, the mysterious fleets of drones being sighted around the United States in recent weeks may be searching for a nuclear weapon that has been smuggled into the country.  The CEO of Saxon Aerospace John Ferguson recently posted a viral TikTok video claiming he knows a person who had knowledge of an old "nuclear warhead" left over from Ukraine by Moscow after the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union.  "I spoke to a gentleman a few months ago, who was trying to raise the alarm to the highest levels of our government...about this one particular nuclear warhead that he physically put his hands on...that was left over from Ukraine...and he knew this thing was headed towards the United States," Ferguson said.  He continued to assess that the drones being sighted on the East Coast are trying to look for radioactive materials, and pointed out the Biden administration is "pushing to get into war with Russia," suggesting a nuke set off in the U.S. could be blamed on the Vladimir Putin-led nation.  Infowars founder Alex Jones commented on the post, writing, "The American's information below is 100% correct. But there is a catch. He is only 100% right about one component. I have been waiting over the last week until I think through the second and third order consequences of telling you what I know. Stand by for the information today. If you ever ignored my warnings in the past and later, wished you would have listened, you want to pay attention now..."  After top podcast host Joe Rogan said Ferguson's video is the first take on the drones that has him "genuinely concerned," Jones replied, "I have confirmed with my sources in USNORTHCOM that this is indeed the purported reason the drones are swarming the NJ/NY area. But there is a lot more to it. I am headed in to the office to shoot a report that will be released today."  As Ferguson's video exploded online, another thread caught the internet's eye as an 𝕏 user called JerseyFutures claiming to be an RF engineer, who has since deleted the account, also alleged the drones are American-made aircraft trying to detect the presence of nuclear radiation from miles away.  The post suggested the U.S. military drones may be looking for a "dirty bomb" around New York.  Meanwhile, the Geiger Counter World Map, which is currently experiencing off and on server issues, has been showing concerning radiation counts on the East Coast.  Confirming the drones are active in New York, Democrat NY Governor Kathy Hochul issued a statement on Saturday revealing the aircraft caused "runways at Stewart Airfield" to be "shut down for approximately one hour," adding, "This has gone too far."  Now, with the chatter that Russia could be blamed in a scenario where a bomb from Ukraine was smuggled into the U.S., it's worth going back to 2022 statements from Russia warning a nuclear false flag could be carried out and blamed on the Kremlin.  In March 2022, Ukraine's Director of Institute for Safety Problems of Nuclear Power Plants (ISPNPP), Anatolii Nosovskyi, warned that looters allegedly stole radioactive isotopes that could be used to make a "dirty bomb" after Russia gained control over the Chernobyl monitoring lab.  Just weeks prior to Nosovskyi's accusation, Russia's Ambassador to Iraq Elbrus Kutrashev said fears of Ukraine deploying a dirty bomb against Russia were a leading factor in the decision to invade Ukraine in the first place.  "Nuclear. [They planned to use] nuclear waste in a bomb, and attack Russia or Russian interests, or maybe a concentration of Russians," he said. "This forced us to choose as a priority of our special operation in Ukraine taking control of the nuclear plant in Chernobyl. We accomplished this successfully at the beginning of the operation."  Alex Jones' 2022 analysis:  The Western mainstream narrative at the time was that Putin allowed the materials to be stolen, which is unconfirmed, in order to engage in a "false flag" dirty bomb attack against Russia.  Moscow has repeatedly warned Western nations about Kiev's alleged plans to use a "dirty bomb" in Ukraine to frame Russia.  Of course, with the CIA and NATO using Ukraine as a proxy army, it is the West that would be behind the dirty bomb plot if Kiev was "behind" an attack.  In July of this year, United Kingdom Parliament Member Andrew Bridgen claimed NATO and other parties were planning a false flag attack on a European city by detonating a nuclear "dirty bomb" to be blamed on Russia and launch WWIII.  Iran could also be blamed for the attack, as Republican Congressman Jefferson Van Drew of New Jersey claimed earlier this month that the New Jersey drones are being launched from an Iranian "mothership" stationed off the East Coast of the United States.  With President-elect Donald Trump set to take office for his second term, is it possible the Deep State scheme to detonate a dirty bomb in Ukraine or Europe was altered to now take place in New York or Washington D.C. in order to disrupt his presidency?  The American political establishment could even try to take Trump out (again) and come in as the saviors, telling the public the drones were trying to keep them safe from the dirty bomb threat and promising retaliation on whoever they blame.
