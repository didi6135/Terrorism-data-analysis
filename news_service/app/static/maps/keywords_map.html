Israel's embassy in Abu Dhabi has been in contact with Kogan's family in the UAE, the statement said, and family members living Israel have also been updated.  The statement called the killing of Kogan "a despicable antisemitic act of terror" and pledged that Israel would use all available means to bring the killers to justice.  The Ynet news site reported that Kogan's car was found abandoned in Al Ain, around 150 kilometers (93 miles) from Abu Dhabi, where Kogan was based. It added, without citing sources, that there were signs of a struggle in the vehicle.  Officials suspect a number of Uzbek citizens recruited by Iran assaulted the rabbi and later fled to Turkey, the report said.  An unnamed official close to UAE authorities told Channel 12 that the country was angry and in shock, adding that senior state and religious officials were investigating.  "It happened after years when there wasn't an unusual security or nationalistic incident," the official was quoted as saying.  Kogan had been missing and presumed dead since Thursday.  Lawmakers and ministers in Israel released a flood of statements Sunday grieving his death and vowing a response to the murder.  President Isaac Herzog said he mourned "with sorrow and outrage," adding in a post on X: "This vile antisemitic attack is a reminder of the inhumanity of the enemies of the Jewish people.  "It will not deter us from continuing to grow flourishing communities in the UAE or anywhere - especially with the help of the dedicated commitment and work of the Chabad emissaries all over the world."  Herzog also thanked UAE authorities for their "swift action," and said he trusted they will do all they can to bring the killers to justice.  Foreign Minister Israel Katz wrote on X that "Israel will not rest nor be silent until those responsible for this criminal act pay for their actions."  "The State of Israel mourns the death of Rabbi Zvi Kogan," Opposition Leader Yair Lapid wrote on X, calling the killing an "antisemitic terror incident" and vowing that the UAE and Israel would cooperate in the investigation.  National Unity chair Benny Gantz also shared his grief on X, vowing that Israel would act and that his "death will not be in vain."  Following the incident, the National Security Council reiterated its travel warning to the UAE, saying there remains a threat against Israelis and Jews in the country.  The UAE has a Level 3 travel warning, the NSC said, meaning all nonessential travel should be avoided.  "Avoid visiting businesses, gathering places, and entertainment venues identified with the Israeli and Jewish population," the warning said. "Maintain increased vigilance in public places (including restaurants, hotels, bars, etc.). Avoid displaying Israeli symbols. Cooperate with local security forces, follow their instructions, and report immediately if you have been exposed to terror activity."  Travelers are also urged to avoid posting on social media and to lock their profiles online.  Kogan was a dual Israeli-Moldovan citizen, and has been part of the Abu Dhabi Chabad chapter since Israel normalized ties with the UAE in late 2020 under a US-brokered agreement dubbed the Abraham Accords. It has maintained the relationship throughout Israel's ongoing 13-month war in Gaza.  According to Ynet, Kogan participated in the first ever Holocaust remembrance day ceremony in the Gulf state in 2021, and led the Yizkor prayer during the event.  Kogan is the nephew of Rabbi Gavriel Holtzberg, who was murdered along with his wife in a terror attack at the Nariman Chabad House in Mumbai in 2008.  Israel has been on high alert for Iranian efforts to harm Israelis and Jews around the world through its various agents and proxies, after the countries exchanged direct military blows for the first time this year.  Iran launched major drone and ballistic missile attacks against Israel in April and October, in response to Israeli strikes on its proxies in Lebanon and Syria. In late October, Israel retaliated with a series of strikes in which dozens of aircraft targeted strategic military sites across Iran as well as air defense batteries.  Iran has vowed to respond but has not yet done so in any major capacity.<br><b>Location:</b> Abu Dhabi<br><b>Date:</b> 2024-11-24T09:27:18Z<br><b>Source:</b> timesofisrael.com<br></div>`)[0];

We honour the memory of the victims lost and pledge to continue the fight against acts of terror together with the Government of India."  Earlier in the day, remembering the victims of the terror attack, Consul General of Israel for Midwest India in Mumbai, Kobbi Shoshani, paid his tribute to the martyrs at Nariman House in Mumbai. Remembering when he came to Colaba a few days after the attacks, he said, "I was sent here at Nariman House in Colaba two-three days after the event took place here. I still remember the ammunition smell. It was very terrible."  He further added that the terrorists wanted to create fear and break the economy, however, as he sees the bustling restaurants, he sees a victory against terrorism. "When I see full restaurants and people walking, buying, shopping and roaming freely, I feel this is the biggest victory against terrorism. The aim of the terrorists was not to kill people, they wanted to create fear and break the economy, but when I see restaurants, shops and people at the train stations and other places, I fully understand that we won against terrorism. India won against terrorism," he said.  Maharashtra Chief Minister Eknath Shinde paid floral tributes to the bravehearts at the Martyrs Memorial in Mumbai.

The man -- Taleb A., according to a report from The Guardian -- fled to Germany as a Saudi Arabian refugee in 2006 and gained official refugee status in 2016.  The 50-year-old left his home country due to its Islamic government and settled in Bernburg, where he worked as a doctor and psychotherapist after receiving his permanent status, according to the Wall Street Journal.  He was prominent in the Saudi community in Germany as an anti-Islam and women's rights activist -- running a website and social media channels dedicated to those causes, the Journal reports.  On his website, he warned prospective refugees to eschew Germany due to what he perceived as the government's tolerance of radical Islam.  The man also posted pro-Israel content in the wake of the Oct. 7 terror attack and was a supporter of Germany's rightwing anti-immigration party AfD, the newspaper reported.  In social media posts days before the attack, the suspect criticized the German government, claiming it was promoting the European nation's Islamization, and also alleged authorities were censoring him because of his views, according to The Wall Street Journal.  Taleb A. is accused of plowing his car through a crowded Christmas market in Madgeburg, injuring dozens and killing at least 2, including a small child, in what authorities are calling a suspected terror attack.  Police operations remain ongoing in Magdeburg and Bernburg, where the suspect lives, The Guardian reports.

Watch's findings and explained that when it released its dossier, Lazzarini would be unable to "claim... that we do not show you the evidence in advance."  UN, ISRAEL AT ODDS OVER CAUSE OF DECLINE IN AID DELIVERIES: 'FALSE NARRATIVES BY INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY'  Neuer's group then released photographs of senior UNRWA staff, including Lazzarini and former UNRWA Commissioner-General Pierre Krahenbuhl, meeting with alleged terror leaders. "You wouldn't find these photos on [UNRWA officials'] own social media," he said. "We found them our own ways, but they don't post them."  Neuer pointed Fox News Digital to two undated photos showing Lazzarini meeting with groups that included members of terror organizations, including the Jihadi Islamic Movement, the Islamic Ansar League, and Hamas.  In another photo dating back to late 2014, multiple UNRWA regional directors met with senior Hamas member Ali Baraka. Neuer said, and reporting from Al Watan Voice confirms, that the UNRWA staff wanted to "to congratulate [Baraka] on Hamas' anniversary."  In another instance, Neuer said he was able to find a photo and transcript from a February 2017 meeting between former UNRWA chief Pierre Krahenbuhl, Baraka, members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), and others. According to U.N. Watch, Krahenbuhl reportedly told the assembly that "we are united, and no one can separate us."  In September 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice announced "terrorism, murder conspiracy, and sanctions-evasion charges" against Baraka and five other Hamas leaders for their roles in Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, terror attack, which killed 40 Americans and over 1,000 others.  UN ACCUSED OF DOWNPLAYING HAMAS TERRORISTS' USE OF GAZA HOSPITALS AS NEW REPORT IGNORES IMPORTANT DETAILS  Krahenbuhl and his staff were investigated in 2019 for reports of "sexual misconduct, nepotism, retaliation, discrimination and other abuses of authority." Krahenbuhl resigned from his position, but in April 2024 was named the head of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). Leading congressional voices requested that Secretary of State Antony Blinken and U.S. Agency for International Development Administrator Samantha Power "persuade the ICRC to reconsider this appointment" given Krahenbuhl's "disastrous tenure" as UNRWA commissioner-general.  Fox News Digital asked the ICRC about the photos of Krahenbuhl posing with terror leaders, and of congressional concern about his fitness for the position in the Red Cross. An spokesperson told Fox News Digital that the ICRC "was not present in the meeting, so it cannot speak to the full context of the discussion."  They also stated that Krahenbuhl "has demonstrated through his work at ICRC and his decades of humanitarian experience that he has one objective: to secure aid to civilians in conflict zones. Meeting with any group that controls access to civilians, is an essential part of the ICRC work and other humanitarian organizations in conflict zones."  U.N. Watch's latest dossier also includes interviews of UNRWA students taken by local Palestinian film crews over a period of three weeks during the summer of 2024. In one interview, a 14-year-old former student of UNRWA's Ein Arik co-ed school said that his school taught him "'to fight back and resist' so that 'Palestine will be liberated and our lands will return to us by the good grace of Allah.'" The child later explains that the solution for Jerusalem is to "kill the Jews. We get rid of the Jews."  A second NGO, IMPACT-se has reported extensively on educational materials used in UNRWA schools for over two decades. In a Nov. 13 report, IMPACT-se names 12 high-ranking UNRWA principals, deputies, directors or deputy directors of training centers who held membership in either Hamas or PIJ. The report notes that nine of the 12 participated in the terror attack of Oct. 7, with "some even serving as Nukhba operatives," members of the special forces units of Hamas. Two of the dual UNRWA- and Hamas-member principals headed schools "under which Hamas tunnels were built."  ISRAELI PARLIAMENT BANS UNRWA OVER TERRORISM TIES, FACES INTERNATIONAL BACKLASH  The latest IMPACT-se review complements findings from March 2023 that two UNRWA schools headed by Hamas members had "promote[d] violence and terrorism in self-created study material." Now, IMPACT-se has named three additional schools where Hamas operatives served as UNRWA staff. The NGO found that these schools promoted "libels against and non-recognition of Israel" and "gratuitously insert[ed] content promoting hatred and violence against Israel into grammar exercises."  IMPACT-se found that UNRWA schools are "shamelessly flout[ing]" UNESCO standards, which include "peace-building, respect for non-Palestinian groups, and avoiding incitement to violence."  The group's report cites intelligence claiming that "over 10% of the 510 [senior] employees in UNRWA's education system in the Gaza Strip," are members of PIJ or Hamas. UNRWA members are not allowed to be participants in terror groups designated by the U.N. Security Council. But as Neuer explained, "The U.N. terror list is one of the thinnest lists in the world," because "Russia and China can block any designation they don't like." Neuer said this means "there's virtually no Palestinian groups" on the list.  Fox News Digital reached out to UNRWA media officials on numerous occasions for its response to the contents of IMPACT-se's and U.N. Watch's dossiers, about allegations that UNRWA schools were not adhering to UNESCO standards, and about Lazzarini's refusal to meet with Neuer.  Bill Deere, director of the UNRWA representative office in Washington, told Fox News Digital, "UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini has cautioned the spread of disinformation against UNRWA," which he says "is meant to create chaos and divert attention from the political aims to dismantle the Agency." Reiterating the content of a statement Lazzarini shared on X in the aftermath of Neuer's dossier being released, Deere said, "UNRWA recommends before giving oxygen to accusations like these, double-check the source and question the intent to avoid becoming an echo chamber for disinformation and de facto the fueling of hate and putting other people's lives in danger."  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Addressing U.N. Watch's interviews with UNRWA students, he said, "What they don't tell you is these children were filmed without the knowledge or permission of their parents," Deere said. "The kids were isolated and asked a series of leading questions designed to elicit a response. This is beyond misleading, it's twisted and desperate."  The U.S. was among numerous countries to pause support to UNRWA in January after the initial proofs emerged of members' participation in the terror attack of Oct. 7. Congress has halted funding to UNRWA through March 2025.<br><b>Location:</b> Geneva<br><b>Date:</b> 2024-12-08T16:25:30Z<br><b>Source:</b> Fox News<br></div>`)[0];

The pro-Palestinian Bronx Anti-War Coalition, a self-described "working-class, BIPOC-led, anti-imperialist" group, organized a rally on Sunday in New York City's Union Square to express solidarity with the "Axis of Resistance," which the group identified as Hezbollah, Iran, Syria, Yemen, and the Iraqi "resistance."  At the event, a speaker donning a keffiyeh issued sharp proclamations, including: "Stop pointing fingers at each other. Our fingers, our pens, our rifles will be pointed at the U.S. government, the Zionist entity, and nobody else."  The rally featured chants repeated by the crowd, calling out "U.S. imperialists" as the "number one terrorists" and voicing unity with regional terror movements.  Participants were seen waving flags representing the Palestinians; Iran, the leading state sponsor of terror; Iraq, where Iranian-backed militias hold significant influence; Lebanon, home to Hezbollah; Syria under Assad's regime, notorious for brutal crackdowns during its civil war; and Yemen, where the Houthi rebels align with Iran.  These were seen alongside Hezbollah's yellow flag, a known emblem of armed resistance and Islamic terror.  Hezbollah, which has actively sought to expand its influence beyond the Middle East, is designated a terrorist organization by more than a dozen countries and international entities, including major Western nations, members of the European Union, and most Arab League member states, due to its involvement in terrorist activities against American, French, Israeli, and other targets.  Former President Donald Trump has denounced Hezbollah, stating, "No terrorist group other than al-Qaeda has more American blood on its hands." Meanwhile, Arkansas Republican Sen. Tom Cotton has called for the elimination of "all of Hezbollah's leadership" while insisting that the United States "should let Israel win" against Tehran's key terrorist proxy in the region.  The event also emphasized anti-sectarianism, with the speaker urging the crowd to "rise above religious differences" and focus on a shared cause.  The "anti-capitalism" Bronx Anti-War Coalition amplified their message on social media, sharing a video of Hamas spokesperson Abu Obeida denouncing sectarianism, as well as a speech by Hezbollah Secretary-General Naim Qassam streamed from Iran's Press TV.  In response, critics took to social media to express outrage over the rally's rhetoric.  "The day will come when these Palestine 'activists' inevitably execute a massive terror attack in NYC. And once they do, don't say we didn't warn you," wrote journalist Eitan Fischberger.  "Hey @RealTomHoman, here are some prime deportation candidates!" wrote conservative commentator Dave Rubin.  "It's never been about Israel, it's always been about destroying Western civilization," wrote activist Eyal Yakoby.  The matter comes as the trend of anti-American sentiment at pro-Palestinian events continues to grow.  According to world-renowned military historian and professor Dr. Victor Davis Hanson, Hamas's "death cult" relies on "useful Western idiots" to support the Palestinian cause, which has "fused with the leftwing DEI industry."  In addition, he predicted over a year ago that pro-Palestinian protests and support for Hamas in the U.S. have alienated many Americans and would all but ensure a tough conservative president in 2024.<br><b>Location:</b> New York City<br><b>Date:</b> 2024-12-18T03:40:36Z<br><b>Source:</b> Breitbart<br></div>`)[0];

The statement from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said Israel "will act with all means to seek justice with the criminals responsible for his death," the AP reports. Israeli authorities did not say how they determined the killing of Zvi Kogan was a terror attack and offered no additional details.  Kogan, 28, an ultra-Orthodox rabbi who went missing on Thursday, ran a Kosher grocery store in the futuristic city of Dubai, where Israelis have flocked for commerce and tourism since the two countries forged diplomatic ties in the 2020 Abraham Accords. The agreement has held through more than a year of soaring regional tensions unleashed by Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack in southern Israel. But Israel's devastating retaliatory offensive in Gaza and its invasion of Lebanon, after months of fighting with the Hezbollah militant group, have stoked anger among Emiratis, Arab nationals, and others living in the the UAE, per the AP.  Iran, which supports Hamas and Hezbollah, also has been threatening to retaliate against Israel after a wave of airstrikes Israel carried out in October in response to an Iranian ballistic missile attack. The Emirati government did not address the disappearance, but a senior Emirati diplomat posted Sunday on X in Arabic that "the UAE will remain a home of safety, an oasis of stability, a society of tolerance and coexistence." The UAE's state-run WAM news agency acknowledged Kogan's disappearance but pointedly did not acknowledge he held Israeli citizenship, referring to him only as being Moldovan. The Emirati Interior Ministry described Kogan as being "missing and out of contact." Netanyahu told a Cabinet meeting later Sunday that he appreciated the cooperation of the UAE in the investigation and that ties between the two countries would continue to be strengthened.

Israel Hayom reported Sunday:  A senior Hamas official currently based in Turkey told Saudi media that the 37th anniversary of the terrorist organization's founding comes during a period of decline due to defeats in Gaza and the broader region.  The official disclosed, "Hamas is suffering from a genuine leadership crisis. The Al-Aqsa Flood attack backfired on us, submerging us in a sea of blood and crises. The most recent blow was the fall of Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria, with which Hamas had been attempting to rebuild relations."  According to a report by the Saudi news site Elaph, the Syrian government has ordered Palestinian terrorist groups to shut down their offices, hand over their weapons, dismantle training camps, and leave Syria as soon as possible. The primary Palestinian group active in Syria has been the Islamic Jihad. In contrast, Hamas's political bureau left Syria earlier due to its support for Islamist rebels at the start of the Syrian civil war, which sparked a rift with Assad.  Israel Hayom also cited reporting that Palestinian terrorists in Syria fled to Iran, but may leave for other countries due to the fear of assassination (Israel is suspected of having killed Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in July.)  There are also Hamas officials in Turkey, and some are in Qatar -- including some who reportedly returned there at the urging of the incoming Trump administration, solely for the purpose of negotiating a hotage deal by January 20.  The report that Hamas leaders are accepting that the October 7 terror attack was a strategic mistake is a reversal from past months, and suggests that Israel is succeeding in restoring a deterrent against its enemies.  However, there are European nations who continue to reward Hamas, with Ireland the latest to join South Africa's "genocide" case against Israel at the International Court of Justice. Ireland, Spain, and Norway also recognized a Palestinian state.<br><b>Location:</b> Turkey<br><b>Date:</b> 2024-12-15T19:03:02Z<br><b>Source:</b> Breitbart<br></div>`)[0];

What we know<br><b>Event body:</b> A Saudi Arabian national was reportedly arrested on Friday after allegedly driving a car into a crowd at a Christmas market in Magdeburg, Germany, killing at least two people and injuring over 50 others.  German newspaper Die Welt reported that a rental car was used to injure or kill between 60 and 80 people at the market, while police had not "ruled out" that an explosive device might have also been used in the apparent attack. The suspect was reportedly born in Saudi Arabia in 1974.  "Officials are saying now that the driver is Saudi," CNN's Jake Tapper said during a broadcast on Friday night. "He is a doctor and has been in Germany since 2006."  While a motive is not yet clear, the nature of Friday's incident and the national origin of the suspect quickly prompted speculation that the incident might have been an Islamist terror attack.  At least 13 people were killed and dozens more injured on December 19, 2016, during a similar incident at a Christmas market in Berlin. The person believed to be responsible, an ISIS-linked extremist, was killed in a shootout days later in Italy.<br><b>Location:</b> Magdeburg<br><b>Date:</b> 2024-12-20T22:22:00Z<br><b>Source:</b> Newsweek<br></div>`)[0];

The students were targeted, according to the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), for engaging in "anti-genocide events on campus." The Intercept reported that police found "antique firearms" registered to the students' brother and brought gun-related charges as a result of his family's "pro-Palestine activism."  Excluded from those descriptions was the crime the sisters are suspected of committing. A group of student radicals defaced George Mason's student center in August, spray painting messages that warned of a "student intifada." In its coverage of the incident, the Washington Post wrote that "activists spray-painted words on Wilkins Plaza outside the university's Johnson Center."  Those activists caused thousands of dollars in damage, a felony in the state of Virginia, and police suspect the SJP leaders, sisters Jena and Noor Chanaa, led the group of vandals. Weeks after the incident, in November, a county judge granted a warrant -- which is under seal until February, according to a Fairfax County court representative -- allowing police to seize electronics from the Chanaa family home.  When officers entered the Chanaa family home, they found firearms -- modern weapons, not antiques -- as well as scores of ammunition and foreign passports, all of which sat in plain view, according to court documents obtained by the Free Beacon and sources familiar with the investigation.  They also found pro-terror materials, including Hamas and Hezbollah flags and signs that read "death to America" and "death to Jews," according to court documents and sources familiar.  Police seized the weapons under Virginia's red flag law, arguing that Mohammad Chanaa, the students' brother and a George Mason alumnus, was "linked to destruction of property in connection with a large group of people with like-minded rhetoric" and posed a danger to others given his possession of "terroristic" materials.  On the day of the search, Nov. 7, law enforcement officials removed "long guns" from the residence, sources say. A day later, Mohammad Chanaa voluntarily relinquished his 9mm handgun and concealed carry permit, according to court records. He was not charged with a crime -- Virginia's red flag law gives gun owners 14 days to petition a judge to return their firearms, and Mohammad Chanaa did so on Nov. 21. A Fairfax County circuit court judge granted his request as part of the civil case.  CAIR has denounced the "draconian measures used by law enforcement authorities" to "silence or intimidate those who seek to end the Israeli genocide in Gaza." A faculty group at George Mason, meanwhile, released a statement expressing "deep concern about the apparent targeting of two George Mason students for their advocacy for Palestinian human rights."  The ongoing ordeal -- local police are investigating the incident with the FBI's assistance, sources familiar with that investigation tell the Free Beacon -- reflects CAIR and SJP's status as driving forces behind the anti-Semitic activism that has plagued college campuses in the wake of Hamas's Oct. 7 terror attack on Israel. It also reflects the radical, pro-terror views that have become synonymous with that activism.  Both Jena and Noor Chanaa have been deeply involved with George Mason's SJP chapter. Jena, a master's student studying civil and infrastructure engineering, served as the chapter's president last school year. Noor, an undergraduate student, took over as co-president this year. Their brother, Mohammad, is a recent George Mason graduate who served in the Springfield, Va., volunteer fire department as recently as Sept. 2023, records show. The three siblings hail from the area and live together in their parents' home.  George Mason did not respond to a request for comment. The FBI declined to comment. A spokeswoman for the Fairfax County commonwealth attorney's office, Laura Birnbaum, confirmed that officers found guns, ammunition, and pro-terror materials during their search and declined to comment further.  The Chanaa family attorney, Abdel-Rahman Hamed, did not respond to a request for comment. In a statement provided to the Washington Post, Hamed said the case marks "yet another example of the police state targeting American Muslims without cause." An "about" section on his LinkedIn page states, "I deny, defy, and defeat Zionists, antisemites, and White Supremacists."  Under Jena and Noor's leadership, George Mason's chapter of SJP has endorsed Hamas and its "martyrs." In a statement issued two days after the Oct. 7 attack, the group lauded the "liberation of the Palestinian people" and endorsed "the right to resist for Palestinians living under the zionist occupation." It said "Palestinian resistance fighters" mobilized "into surrounding occupied areas" on Oct. 7, "reclaiming land and settlements considered illegal" in the name of "decolonization."  "Decolonization entails the struggle for liberation of a colonized people from the grasp of their colonizers," the statement read. "This struggle for the much-sought after liberation from the colonizer is not meant to be metaphysical -- but material."  "Every Palestinian is a civilian even if they hold arms. A settler is an aggressor, a soldier, and an occupier even if they are lounging on our occupied beaches."  The group went on to hold campus protests rallying support for "Palestinian martyrs" and "the resistance." On the one-year anniversary of Oct. 7, Jena Chanaa posted a photo of smiling Gazans on top of an Israeli military vehicle. "One year ago we witnessed Gaza break through the prison doors. No cage will ever be strong enough to hold the colonized," she wrote in a caption. "We have tasted liberation and will free ourselves in this lifetime. Glory to every single martyr in Gaza, Lebanon, and Yemen. May the earth burn for Gaza and may we avenge our martyrs every single day."  Months earlier, in a pair of Instagram posts, she wrote that her family comes from "Taytaba in North Palestine" and expressed a willingness to "die in my homeland."  "76 years have passed since the forced expulsion of my family," she said. "76 years of resistance to the occupation. 76 years of steadfastness and determination. 76 years of the complete belief that we will inevitably return."  Jena and Noor Chanaa and their associates appear to have leveled more aggressive threats toward their school through a pseudonym, using an Instagram account, "gmuintifada." The account posted a video of the Aug. 30 vandalism the sisters are suspected of leading with the caption:  We, the George Mason University students of conscience, bear witness to the atrocities funded and supplied by our university, and we have chosen to retaliate. During the early hours of Wednesday morning, autonomous students left the imperial George Mason University a message: that the student intifada has been reignited, and that we will honor all the Gazan martyrs who did not live to witness this academic year. University administrations across the nation have convinced themselves that they can suffocate the flames of resistance that have been unleashed since the inception of this genocide. Yet, what they fail to realize is that their every effort to stifle our voices and eradicate our movement for liberation has only provoked an inferno that will engulf all systems of oppression that are upholding the genocide of the steadfast and honorable Palestinians. George Mason University, you will NEVER be able to escape accountability for your role in this genocide. Gaza is our compass and the heart of our noble struggle and the Student Intifada will confront every dousing of our eternal flame of resistance with precision. We will never be extinguished. Resistance until victory, GMU Intifada #escalate4gaza #studentintifada.  Shortly thereafter, George Mason police offered a $2,000 reward "for information leading to the successful arrests of the persons involved in the criminal vandalism incident." The "gmuintifada" account has since been deleted from Instagram.  In the wake of the November search on the Chanaa home, George Mason slapped its SJP chapter with an interim suspension, according to a coalition of student groups affiliated with the chapter. University police also served Jena and Noor Chanaa "with criminal trespass notices barring them from campus for four years," according to the Intercept.  CAIR has called on George Mason to rescind those disciplinary measures.  University leaders see the case differently, with George Mason president Gregory Washington calling the school's actions "justified based on the information available" in a Nov. 20 faculty senate meeting. So do state and local law enforcement officials.  "For us at the state and local level, you know, we're concerned," one official told the Free Beacon, noting CAIR's ties to illicit fundraising efforts for Hamas as well as recent revelations that Iran has bankrolled anti-Israel campus protests in the United States.  "It clearly shows the connection between potential radicalization and some of these student groups that are out there," the official added. "It needs to be investigated if these are just sympathies, or is there a road to radicalization?"<br><b>Location:</b> George Mason University<br><b>Date:</b> 2024-12-09T21:25:03Z<br><b>Source:</b> Washington Free Beacon<br></div>`)[0];

In October 2023, the same billboard featured Biden with an American flag and an Israeli flag, with the simple word "Thanks!" Israelis were grateful for Biden's visit and weapons supplies in the aftermath of the October 7 terror attack.  But as Biden began more critical of Israel, and tried to restrain its war effort, the image was taken down from the billboard, which is along Emek Refaim Street, a heavily American area of Jerusalem known as the German Colony.  The Trump billboard recalls some of the laudatory street decorations at the time of the opening of the U.S. embassy in Jerusalem in 2018, when locals were effusive in their praise of the 45th president for fulfilling a bipartisan promise.  As Breitbart News noted in October, polls of Israelis showed overwhelming support for Trump in the U.S. presidential election, and very little support for Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee. One poll had Trump at 66% among Israelis, and Harris at only 17%.  Israelis hope Trump will let them defeat their enemies, and reach peace deals with Arab states that want to move on beyond the conflicts of the past century.<br><b>Location:</b> Jerusalem<br><b>Date:</b> 2024-11-21T01:54:49Z<br><b>Source:</b> Breitbart<br></div>`)[0];

In a post on X, the AP shared an article with the title, "At least 2 dead and 60 hurt after a car drives into a German Christmas market in a suspected attack."  "A car has driven into a group of people at a Christmas market in Germany," the AP wrote in its post on X.  As Breitbart News's Kurt Zindulka reported, a man, who is "reportedly from Saudi Arabia" drove a car through "a crowd of people at a Christmas market" in the city of Magdeburg.  The community notes for the AP's post on X explains:  "A car has driven" implies the car drove itself, which is factually incorrect. A man from Saudi Arabia intentionally drove the car into the Christmas market as a terror attack.  Several people responded to the AP's post on X, questioning "who was driving the car" and criticizing the establishment media for writing "headlines like this" instead of being honest.  "The media likes to write headlines like this because instead of being honest about the driver being a terrorist, they hope you may just think it's one of those evil Elon Musk self driving cars acting up again," another person wrote in a post on X.

Base security found the pair suspicious, and when pressed for identification, the two men, Hasan Y. Hamdan and Mohammad K. Dabous attempted to gain access to the facility. They were stopped and apprehended, shedding light on not just how many times American military bases face infiltration from non-citizens on a weekly basis but whether this was a test run for a terror attack. We'll never know because the case was dismissed (via Potomac Local News):  The cases against two men from Jordan accused of illegally attempting to enter Quantico Marine base have been dismissed.  In earlier court appearances, the Jordanians identified as Hasan Y. Hamdan and Mohammad K. Dabous were released after being charged with misdemeanors stemming from a May 3 incident for attempting to "trespass" on the headquarters of the U.S. Marine Corps, home of the FBI Training Academy and the military's top criminal investigative agencies.  The case garnered national attention, including pleas from Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who demanded answers from President Joe Biden's administration. The duo's identities were finally disclosed at the end of July following exhausted efforts made by congressional leaders in addition to Youngkin.  Prior to the recent dismissal, the Department of Justice accused the pair of "unlawfully go[ing] upon a military installation for a purpose prohibited by law, to wit: knowingly and intentionally entering Marine Corps Base Quantico," according to court documents.  During their July court appearance, Hamdan and Dabous were granted release upon condition to appear for "all future court appearances," including immigration appearances they have "pending." They were ordered "not further trespass on Marine Corps Base Quantico or any other military installation."  We're just letting these guys go, released into the wind for attempting to infiltrate a military installation.

The German broadcaster MDR said that at least one person had been killed and several injured in the incident in the state of Saxony-Anhalt. Eyewitnesses told the broadcaster that the car drove straight into a crowd.  Police arrested a person in connection with the incident, according to the German press agency DPA.  A spokesperson for the Saxony-Anhalt regional government told the agency that it was "probably an attack".  "This is a terrible event, particularly now in the days before Christmas," the state's prime minister, Reiner Haseloff, said.  The incident comes almost eight years to the day since 12 people were killed and 49 injured in 2016, when a 24-year-old Tunisian failed asylum seeker drove into a Christmas market in Berlin. A 13th victim of the attack, which was claimed by the jihadist group Isis, died in 2021.  German federal interior minister Nancy Faeser recently called for vigilance when visiting Christmas markets. Speaking at the end of November, she said that there was no concrete evidence of an immediate threat, but she added: "Given the high level of threat in the abstract, we still have reason to be very vigilant and to act consistently for our security."  The incident comes as Germany gears up for early elections in February, in which migration and law and order are set to feature strongly. The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) is currently polling in second place.  The party secured a historic first place finish in regional elections in the state of Thuringia earlier this year, and finished second in two other eastern German states. The votes took place shortly after a terror attack in August in the town of Solingen, when a Syrian national suspected of being a member of Isis fatally stabbed three people and injured eight others.<br><b>Location:</b> Magdeburg<br><b>Date:</b> 2024-12-20T20:28:50Z<br><b>Source:</b> Financial Times News<br></div>`)[0];

Israeli settlers have set fire to a mosque in the occupied West Bank, while also defacing the building's facade with hateful and racist slogans such as "Revenge" and "Death to Arabs" spray-painted in Hebrew.  Abdallah Kamil, the governor of Salfit, said on Friday that the attack targeted the Bar al-Walidain mosque in the village of Marda, in the latest incident of settler violence.  "A group of settlers carried out an attack early this morning by setting fire to the mosque," Kamil said in a statement.  One resident of the village told AFP news agency that the settlers "set fire to the entrance of the mosque and wrote Hebrew slogans on its walls".  Another resident said the fire was extinguished before it could engulf the entire structure.  Nasfat al-Khufash, head of the Marda village council, also confirmed the "systematic terror attack by a group of settlers", in an interview with Reuters news agency.  The Israeli settlements on Palestinian land in the occupied West Bank are considered illegal by the United Nations and under international law.  Governor Kamil said that settlers had previously entered the village "under the protection of the Israeli army", and that similar acts of vandalism and graffiti had been reported in nearby areas.  Palestine's Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Ramallah condemned the incident, calling it a "blatant act of racism" and a reflection of the "widespread incitement campaigns against our people carried out by elements of the extremist right-wing ruling government" of Israel.  The Israeli police and Shin Bet security services said in a joint statement: "We see this incident as extremely serious and will act resolutely to bring the perpetrators to justice for rigorous trial."  Settler violence in the illegally occupied West Bank has intensified since the war in Gaza began on October 7 last year. As of October 2024, there have been at least 1,400 settler attacks in the West Bank.  Since the start of the war on Gaza, at least 803 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank by Israeli forces or settlers, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry.<br><b>Location:</b> West Bank<br><b>Date:</b> 2024-12-20T12:39:53Z<br><b>Source:</b> Al Jazeera Online<br></div>`)[0];

Cities and towns have scrambled to accommodate them, shelling out tens of billions of taxpayer dollars and surrendering hotels and valuable public space for the cause.

Europe is awash with radical Muslims who wish death upon infidels, and Germany allowed hordes of these people into their country. At a local Christmas market in Magdeburg, one man, a reported Saudi Arabian, plowed through a crowd, killing at least several people and wounding as many as 60-80 others. We don't have official numbers yet (via NYT) [WARNING: Some graphic images]:  A driver rammed a vehicle into a Christmas market in the city of Magdeburg in central Germany on Friday evening, killing at least one person and wounding dozens of others, in what local officials said they suspected had been an attack.  The driver of the vehicle was arrested, according to local news reports.  At least of 68 people were wounded, 15 of them severely, said Michael Reif, the spokesman for the city of Magdeburg. Mr. Reif and a regional government spokesman, Matthias Schuppe, both said they suspected the episode had not been an accident, according to the German public broadcaster.  "This is a terrible event, especially now in the days leading up to Christmas," Reiner Haseloff, the governor of Saxony-Anhalt state, where Magdeburg is the capital, told the German wire service D.P.A.  More than 1,000 temporary Christmas markets pop up every year in Germany, and they have been the target of terrorists in the past. In 2016, an extremist rammed a truck into a crowd in Berlin, killing 13. Since then, the police have secured many Christmas markets with temporary barriers.  It's a terror attack, and the suspect isn't some "driver." That's the shameful part that's being omitted. The headlines read as if this vehicle got a life of its own, like something out of Stephen King's Christine. It was a Muslim man who decided he wanted to commit an act of radical Islamic terrorism. It's not just this incident.  When it comes to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and similar events, where terrorists try to run over Jews at bus stations, the Associated Press, one of the worst offenders of this trend, acts as if no one drove the cars. The suspect was also known to German security forces.<br><b>Location:</b> Magdeburg<br><b>Date:</b> 2024-12-20T21:24:07Z<br><b>Source:</b> Townhall<br></div>`)[0];

Six GOP-led House committees declared in a joint report that "antisemitism has been allowed to fester unchecked" due to "a disturbing pattern of defensiveness and denial," according to a copy exclusively obtained by The Post.  "Across the nation, Jewish Americans have been harassed, assaulted, intimidated, and subjected to hostile environments -- violations that stand in stark contrast to America's fundamental values, including a foundational commitment to religious freedom for all," the 42-page report says.  "The failure of our federal government departments and agencies is astounding."  The outpouring of anti-Israel and anti-Jewish remarks and actions tested America's free speech precepts and the fact that hate speech is generally lawful in the United States, unless it amounts to harassment or is an aggravating factor in a criminal act such as assault.  The Republican-led report points out, however, that federal law generally prevents recipients of taxpayer funds from tolerating discrimination -- allowing a foothold to leverage recipients to stiffen policies on campuses and at medical settings should federal officials so choose.  In almost every case, institutions allegedly took almost no disciplinary action against alleged antisemites and made no changes to codes of conduct, and faced no loss of grants to stop the rapidly spreading Jew hatred.  The report focuses heavily on Columbia University and its recommendations urge federal agencies to use money to incentivize more stringent anti-discrimination policies -- and also proposes potential legislation to that effect.  "The executive branch should aggressively enforce Title VI [anti-discrimination rules] and hold schools accountable for their failures to protect students. Universities that fail to fulfill the obligations upon which their federal funding is predicated or whose actions make clear they are unfit stewards of taxpayer  dollars should be treated accordingly," the Republican panels said.  High-profile reports of antisemitism -- mirrored by anti-Palestinian incidents that also occurred, especially during rallies and counter-rallies over the Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip -- was just the tip of the iceberg, according to the investigation.  In one alarming incident, a student overheard two health care providers at Columbia's medical school discussing whether or not to "treat her because she was Israeli."  "She sat in the room for another 10 minutes until someone finally came to address her health needs As of mid-December 2024, representatives of Columbia University have not provided any information to the Committees as a part of this investigation beyond an October 2, 2024, response of basic platitudes."  The Ivy League school, which was the site of a large encampment that featured on its fringes multiple documented instances of anti-Jewish remarks against pro-Israel activists and Jewish students, also reneged on a vow to punish students accused of breaking the rules to protest against Israel.  "Columbia said the 22 students arrested for the criminal takeover of Hamilton Hall would face expulsion. Instead, the University lifted the students' interim suspensions after pushback from radical faculty, allowing 7 to graduate, restoring 11 to good standing, and leaving 3 with preexisting sanctions suspended and 1 on probation," the report said.  "Despite dozens of students being arrested for conduct related to Hamilton Hall and the encampment,  or having faced discipline for other egregious antisemitic incidents; Columbia failed to expel students and issued final suspensions to only four students."  Some of the anti-Israel protesters at Columbia were themselves Jewish and argued that the protest was not pervasively antisemitic -- despite reported instances.  The document says that, unexpectedly, "many colleges handed down disparate disciplinary actions for Jewish students versus their antagonists -- the students who engaged in antisemitic behavior, encampments, and intimidating tactics such as campus checkpoints and tax-exempt organizations that enabled and funded violent campus protests."  Columbia, for example, "allowed a false narrative that Jewish students had perpetrated a 'chemical attack' at an anti-Israel rally to persist for months despite knowing it was false and that the students involved had merely sprayed novelty 'fart sprays.'  "In an apparent case of disparate treatment, the Jewish students responsible were given excessive year-and-a-half long suspensions, substantially longer than any suspension for antisemitic conduct violations," the report says.  "Columbia failed to correct the record despite requests from the Jewish community, even as anti-Israel students used the false narrative of a 'chemical attack' purportedly involving military-grade 'skunk spray' to demonize Jewish students and call for excluding Israelis.  "Columbia finally acknowledged that the incident was not a 'chemical attack' in August 2024, pursuant to a settlement with one of the Jewish students excessively disciplined, which also awarded the student $395,000 and modified the suspension to conditional disciplinary probation."  Allegedly biased institutions such as Columbia University, the University of Southern California, UCLA, George Washington University, Harvard University, and Yale University pocketed $2.7 billion in federal funds just in fiscal year 2023, which concluded right before Hamas terrorists invaded the Jewish state and killed more than 1,200 people -- including 33 Americans, the report says.  The probe, which was launched after House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) and other Republicans took a tour of the anti-Israel encampment at Columbia, touched on many federal agencies.  The State Department and Department of Homeland Security allegedly stonewalled records requests about the visa statuses of those harassing Jewish students with terror-infused tirades -- or else discovered that government money was being funneled to tax-exempt charities  "Rather than confronting the severity of the problem, many institutions have dismissed congressional and public criticism and abdicated responsibility for the hostile environments they have enabled," the report states.  "This refusal to acknowledge or address the issue has allowed antisemitism to take root and thrive in spaces that contravene the values of this great nation."<br><b>Location:</b> Columbia University<br><b>Date:</b> 2024-12-19T13:04:29Z<br><b>Source:</b> New York Post<br></div>`)[0];

Smells Like A False Flag...<br><b>Event body:</b> Drone sightings have exploded across the country involving a wide variety of devices - but the incidents that concern me the most are those involving the SUV-sized UAVs in places like New Jersey.  The term "False Flag" gets thrown around rather haphazardly these days and it's important to recognize that a real false flag requires a particular end result - The public blaming the wrong culprit for an event that someone else (usually our own government) perpetrated. When it comes to the increasing fervor over major drone activity across the US, I have very little doubt that what we are witnessing is a false flag scenario.  First, let's outline what has happened so far: Drone sightings have exploded across the country involving a wide variety of devices - but the incidents that concern me the most are those involving the SUV-sized UAVs in places like New Jersey. The sightings have been happening for months. US government agencies including the FBI, DHS and national security officials claim they have no idea who is behind this activity, even though drones have been seen operating over highly protected areas like US military bases.  There's a lot of information to be gleaned here if you know what you're looking for. I have written extensively about drones and drone warfare in my survival newsletter over the years, primarily on new developments in the technology and ways for civilians to defeat that technology. However, I have also written on how civilians can use drones for their own self defense.  I know enough about tracking technology to say with relative certainly that officials are lying about the drones over New Jersey, and probably about most of the covert drone activity in other parts of the country. They know who is controlling these drones, and it's most likely our own government. What we are witnessing is some form of false flag in progress.  First and foremost, drones can indeed be tracked rather easily depending on where they fly. Remote signals going back to the operator can be tracked with the right equipment. The stronger the remote signal the easier it is to find the operator. In New Jersey, for example, US Air Force Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst partnered with AeroDefense, a local business specializing in tracking technology and drone detection, to produce a system to track drones across the installation as well as pinpoint perpetrators who fly them. They started this program back in 2020.  Drone company DJI, which controls around 90% of the consumer drone market, has their own proprietary drone tracking technology that can be purchased by governments and various agencies. There's likely dozens more companies out there right now producing similar products to the DJI tracking tech.  Under new FAA regulations instituted this year, all drones operating in US air space (except very small drones) are required to carry a Remote ID module which broadcasts operator information and location. Most drones now have Remote ID integrated into their software and removing it can be a pain. For example, DJI drones are basically no longer used by Ukrainian forces because the built-in Remote ID gives away their positions. They now build most of their drones from scratch.  There are ways around drone tracking (to a point). Remote ID spoofing devices can be built and programmed for as little as $20. These broadcasting modules can create the illusion of dozens of drones in the sky with false operator data included. Anyone trying to use Remote ID tracking to find you will have no idea which drones are real and which are fake.  Drone signal repeaters (which function much like ham radio repeaters) are not uncommon and are used in Ukraine by both sides to help confuse tracking attempts. Signal repeaters and antennas are easy to hide, and pinpointing an exact location is difficult. In Ukraine, trackers would simply find a general area where the antenna or operator might be and then hit it with artillery. If they only hit a repeater, then the operator is out about $200 and that's it.  The Russians use drones connected to long spools of fiber optic cable which allows them to send the devices into areas protecting by jamming. The direct connection also keeps the operators from being tracked.  Then there are drones with AI software which bypass a lot of tracking tools. If the drone is controlling itself then there's no operator signal to trace. The drone might be broadcasting a video signal but that's not going to give up the location of the people who deployed the drone.  Most of these techniques would never be used by common civilians or even small terror groups (AI flight software in particular would only be used by governments). On top of that, access to large drones or car-sized drones is very rare for civilians and requires extensive permits. The cost of such devices is prohibitive (tens-of-thousands or hundreds-of-thousands of dollars depending on the drone).  My point is, there is no way civilian operators or small terror groups are behind the majority of these events. The level of sophistication involved here requires military or government agency oversight. Beyond that, there aren't enough countermeasures in the world to prevent tracking over sensitive government locations. The US military and DHS have extensive means to track down drones (especially large drones) flying in close proximity to bases and protected sites.  Triangulation would not be hard given the drone operators would have to fly through the middle of multiple detection equipped facilities. And, even if the drones are AI operated, large drones are not very fast or nimble. They could be followed without much trouble by helicopters or other drones.  Lack of public knowledge on this issue is being exploited by government officials and the media. I have seen multiple agency representatives claim that there's "not enough restrictions in place" to keep the threat of domestic drones in check. I have also seen government reps claim these drones are being operated by a foreign enemy like Iran. Recently, at least two men were arrested for flying a small drone too close to an airport in Chicago - Federal agencies and the media have tried to link these men to the covert drone sighting across the country when it's likely they have nothing to do with the situation.  Misinformation like this suggests an attempt to pin the drone activity on civilian sources, or, a foreign adversary working with civilian sources. In other words, they are preparing the ground for one of two outcomes: More aggressive restrictions on civilian drones, or, an drone attack that is blamed on a foreign government.  The size of the drones is what worries me most. If the goal of a foreign government was to monitor sensitive sites and collect information, they wouldn't use car-sized drones. Large drones would be too easy to trace. They would use small mid-range drones outfitted with thermal that fit in a backpack.  But, our own government could fly fleets of large drones over cites and military bases with impunity. If our government wanted to, say, blow up a sacrificial military facility, damage a nuclear power plant or hit a civilian center, car-sized drones would be very useful because they are designed to carry considerable weight. Drones like those sighted over New Jersey could carry 500-1000 pounds of ordnance (maybe more). A swarm of these drones could cause total havoc in a heavily populated area.  I worry about this outcome because the Biden Administration and the globalist establishment have been very active in the past several months trying to create as many ignition points for world war as they possibly can before Donald Trump takes office in January. A false flag at this time makes perfect sense.  My second theory is based on the strange comments by defense officials linking the activity to lack of restrictions on the civilian drone market. As noted, there is NO WAY civilians are flying car-sized drones in US airspace over protected sites without being followed. The drones are too expensive, too big to move around without people noticing and that kind of operation requires insider knowledge of DoD and DHS tracking methods.  Some have speculated that there may be an agenda to get legislation (like a new Patriot Act) passed in the near future. I believe this may be a ploy to get traction on legislation restricting or banning civilian ownership of drones. Some people might be skeptical about that idea, but consider for a moment how useful drones are to a potential populist rebellion...  For over a century, governments and national armies have had a monopoly on aerial surveillance and the ability to engage enemies from the sky. With the invention of drones many patriots and survivalists have viewed the technology as the biggest threat to future attempts at rebellion against the establishment. The devices are cheap to produce, can operate in forests and urban environments and even small drones can carry enough explosives to maim or possibly kill with precision.  In the past, smaller forces using asymmetric tactics could still gain the upper hand against governments, even when fighting an advanced military with air superiority. Drones are now treated as the end game for insurgencies. But the truth is quite the opposite; drones are the end game for standard armies and a huge advantage for asymmetric rebellions. Drones are the biggest game changer in warfare for civilians since the invention of the repeating rifle.  We have seen the face of combat change dramatically in the war in Ukraine as drones become increasingly vital for both sides. Medium-sized drones have disrupted typical maneuver warfare tactics using high explosives to disable armored columns. Small drones allow operators to monitor the battlefield from the sky for miles and make discreet troop movements impossible.  Drones can be easily used by civilians for the same purposes. For the first time ever, patriots have access to the air for surveillance and defense. I would not be surprised to see governments fabricate reasons why the technology "needs to be banned" - They will try to sell the American people on the idea that drones are a danger to public safety, even if that requires bankrolling a terror attack to frighten people into compliance.  In either case - A trigger for WWIII or a test case for banning the civilian drone market, the establishment gains an advantage. As far as I can tell, no one else benefits from these drone incidents. All signs point to a false flag.

Smells Like A False Flag...<br><b>Event body:</b> Drone sightings have exploded across the country involving a wide variety of devices - but the incidents that concern me the most are those involving the SUV-sized UAVs in places like New Jersey.  The term "False Flag" gets thrown around rather haphazardly these days and it's important to recognize that a real false flag requires a particular end result - The public blaming the wrong culprit for an event that someone else (usually our own government) perpetrated. When it comes to the increasing fervor over major drone activity across the US, I have very little doubt that what we are witnessing is a false flag scenario.  First, let's outline what has happened so far: Drone sightings have exploded across the country involving a wide variety of devices - but the incidents that concern me the most are those involving the SUV-sized UAVs in places like New Jersey. The sightings have been happening for months. US government agencies including the FBI, DHS and national security officials claim they have no idea who is behind this activity, even though drones have been seen operating over highly protected areas like US military bases.  There's a lot of information to be gleaned here if you know what you're looking for. I have written extensively about drones and drone warfare in my survival newsletter over the years, primarily on new developments in the technology and ways for civilians to defeat that technology. However, I have also written on how civilians can use drones for their own self defense.  I know enough about tracking technology to say with relative certainly that officials are lying about the drones over New Jersey, and probably about most of the covert drone activity in other parts of the country. They know who is controlling these drones, and it's most likely our own government. What we are witnessing is some form of false flag in progress.  First and foremost, drones can indeed be tracked rather easily depending on where they fly. Remote signals going back to the operator can be tracked with the right equipment. The stronger the remote signal the easier it is to find the operator. In New Jersey, for example, US Air Force Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst partnered with AeroDefense, a local business specializing in tracking technology and drone detection, to produce a system to track drones across the installation as well as pinpoint perpetrators who fly them. They started this program back in 2020.  Drone company DJI, which controls around 90% of the consumer drone market, has their own proprietary drone tracking technology that can be purchased by governments and various agencies. There's likely dozens more companies out there right now producing similar products to the DJI tracking tech.  Under new FAA regulations instituted this year, all drones operating in US air space (except very small drones) are required to carry a Remote ID module which broadcasts operator information and location. Most drones now have Remote ID integrated into their software and removing it can be a pain. For example, DJI drones are basically no longer used by Ukrainian forces because the built-in Remote ID gives away their positions. They now build most of their drones from scratch.  There are ways around drone tracking (to a point). Remote ID spoofing devices can be built and programmed for as little as $20. These broadcasting modules can create the illusion of dozens of drones in the sky with false operator data included. Anyone trying to use Remote ID tracking to find you will have no idea which drones are real and which are fake.  Drone signal repeaters (which function much like ham radio repeaters) are not uncommon and are used in Ukraine by both sides to help confuse tracking attempts. Signal repeaters and antennas are easy to hide, and pinpointing an exact location is difficult. In Ukraine, trackers would simply find a general area where the antenna or operator might be and then hit it with artillery. If they only hit a repeater, then the operator is out about $200 and that's it.  The Russians use drones connected to long spools of fiber optic cable which allows them to send the devices into areas protecting by jamming. The direct connection also keeps the operators from being tracked.  Then there are drones with AI software which bypass a lot of tracking tools. If the drone is controlling itself then there's no operator signal to trace. The drone might be broadcasting a video signal but that's not going to give up the location of the people who deployed the drone.  Most of these techniques would never be used by common civilians or even small terror groups (AI flight software in particular would only be used by governments). On top of that, access to large drones or car-sized drones is very rare for civilians and requires extensive permits. The cost of such devices is prohibitive (tens-of-thousands or hundreds-of-thousands of dollars depending on the drone).  My point is, there is no way civilian operators or small terror groups are behind the majority of these events. The level of sophistication involved here requires military or government agency oversight. Beyond that, there aren't enough countermeasures in the world to prevent tracking over sensitive government locations. The US military and DHS have extensive means to track down drones (especially large drones) flying in close proximity to bases and protected sites.  Triangulation would not be hard given the drone operators would have to fly through the middle of multiple detection equipped facilities. And, even if the drones are AI operated, large drones are not very fast or nimble. They could be followed without much trouble by helicopters or other drones.  Lack of public knowledge on this issue is being exploited by government officials and the media. I have seen multiple agency representatives claim that there's "not enough restrictions in place" to keep the threat of domestic drones in check. I have also seen government reps claim these drones are being operated by a foreign enemy like Iran. Recently, at least two men were arrested for flying a small drone too close to an airport in Chicago - Federal agencies and the media have tried to link these men to the covert drone sighting across the country when it's likely they have nothing to do with the situation.  Misinformation like this suggests an attempt to pin the drone activity on civilian sources, or, a foreign adversary working with civilian sources. In other words, they are preparing the ground for one of two outcomes: More aggressive restrictions on civilian drones, or, an drone attack that is blamed on a foreign government.  The size of the drones is what worries me most. If the goal of a foreign government was to monitor sensitive sites and collect information, they wouldn't use car-sized drones. Large drones would be too easy to trace. They would use small mid-range drones outfitted with thermal that fit in a backpack.  But, our own government could fly fleets of large drones over cites and military bases with impunity. If our government wanted to, say, blow up a sacrificial military facility, damage a nuclear power plant or hit a civilian center, car-sized drones would be very useful because they are designed to carry considerable weight. Drones like those sighted over New Jersey could carry 500-1000 pounds of ordnance (maybe more). A swarm of these drones could cause total havoc in a heavily populated area.  I worry about this outcome because the Biden Administration and the globalist establishment have been very active in the past several months trying to create as many ignition points for world war as they possibly can before Donald Trump takes office in January. A false flag at this time makes perfect sense.  My second theory is based on the strange comments by defense officials linking the activity to lack of restrictions on the civilian drone market. As noted, there is NO WAY civilians are flying car-sized drones in US airspace over protected sites without being followed. The drones are too expensive, too big to move around without people noticing and that kind of operation requires insider knowledge of DoD and DHS tracking methods.  Some have speculated that there may be an agenda to get legislation (like a new Patriot Act) passed in the near future. I believe this may be a ploy to get traction on legislation restricting or banning civilian ownership of drones. Some people might be skeptical about that idea, but consider for a moment how useful drones are to a potential populist rebellion...  For over a century, governments and national armies have had a monopoly on aerial surveillance and the ability to engage enemies from the sky. With the invention of drones many patriots and survivalists have viewed the technology as the biggest threat to future attempts at rebellion against the establishment. The devices are cheap to produce, can operate in forests and urban environments and even small drones can carry enough explosives to maim or possibly kill with precision.  In the past, smaller forces using asymmetric tactics could still gain the upper hand against governments, even when fighting an advanced military with air superiority. Drones are now treated as the end game for insurgencies. But the truth is quite the opposite; drones are the end game for standard armies and a huge advantage for asymmetric rebellions. Drones are the biggest game changer in warfare for civilians since the invention of the repeating rifle.  We have seen the face of combat change dramatically in the war in Ukraine as drones become increasingly vital for both sides. Medium-sized drones have disrupted typical maneuver warfare tactics using high explosives to disable armored columns. Small drones allow operators to monitor the battlefield from the sky for miles and make discreet troop movements impossible.  Drones can be easily used by civilians for the same purposes. For the first time ever, patriots have access to the air for surveillance and defense. I would not be surprised to see governments fabricate reasons why the technology "needs to be banned" - They will try to sell the American people on the idea that drones are a danger to public safety, even if that requires bankrolling a terror attack to frighten people into compliance.  In either case - A trigger for WWIII or a test case for banning the civilian drone market, the establishment gains an advantage. As far as I can tell, no one else benefits from these drone incidents. All signs point to a false flag. If this reality is exposed widely enough, I expect that the government will finally admit that they were behind the drone flights, but only as an effort to "protect the public" from an insidious threat that they could not tell us about beforehand.<br><b>Location:</b> New Jersey<br><b>Date:</b> 2024-12-16T19:09:49Z<br><b>Source:</b> Infowars<br></div>`)[0];

Large drones would be too easy to trace. They would use small mid-range drones outfitted with thermal that fit in a backpack.  But, our own government could fly fleets of large drones over cites and military bases with impunity. If our government wanted to, say, blow up a sacrificial military facility, damage a nuclear power plant or hit a civilian center, car-sized drones would be very useful because they are designed to carry considerable weight. Drones like those sighted over New Jersey could carry 500-1000 pounds of ordnance (maybe more). A swarm of these drones could cause total havoc in a heavily populated area.  I worry about this outcome because the Biden Administration and the globalist establishment have been very active in the past several months trying to create as many ignition points for world war as they possibly can before Donald Trump takes office in January. A false flag at this time makes perfect sense.  My second theory is based on the strange comments by defense officials linking the activity to lack of restrictions on the civilian drone market. As noted, there is NO WAY civilians are flying car-sized drones in US airspace over protected sites without being followed. The drones are too expensive, too big to move around without people noticing and that kind of operation requires insider knowledge of DoD and DHS tracking methods.  Some have speculated that there may be an agenda to get legislation (like a new Patriot Act) passed in the near future.

Some people might be skeptical about that idea, but consider for a moment how useful drones are to a potential populist rebellion...  For over a century, governments and national armies have had a monopoly on aerial surveillance and the ability to engage enemies from the sky. With the invention of drones many patriots and survivalists have viewed the technology as the biggest threat to future attempts at rebellion against the establishment. The devices are cheap to produce, can operate in forests and urban environments and even small drones can carry enough explosives to maim or possibly kill with precision.  In the past, smaller forces using asymmetric tactics could still gain the upper hand against governments, even when fighting an advanced military with air superiority. Drones are now treated as the end game for insurgencies. But the truth is quite the opposite; drones are the end game for standard armies and a huge advantage for asymmetric rebellions. Drones are the biggest game changer in warfare for civilians since the invention of the repeating rifle.  We have seen the face of combat change dramatically in the war in Ukraine as drones become increasingly vital for both sides. Medium-sized drones have disrupted typical maneuver warfare tactics using high explosives to disable armored columns. Small drones allow operators to monitor the battlefield from the sky for miles and make discreet troop movements impossible.  Drones can be easily used by civilians for the same purposes.

Smells Like A False Flag...<br><b>Event body:</b> Drone sightings have exploded across the country involving a wide variety of devices - but the incidents that concern me the most are those involving the SUV-sized UAVs in places like New Jersey.  The term "False Flag" gets thrown around rather haphazardly these days and it's important to recognize that a real false flag requires a particular end result - The public blaming the wrong culprit for an event that someone else (usually our own government) perpetrated. When it comes to the increasing fervor over major drone activity across the US, I have very little doubt that what we are witnessing is a false flag scenario.  First, let's outline what has happened so far: Drone sightings have exploded across the country involving a wide variety of devices - but the incidents that concern me the most are those involving the SUV-sized UAVs in places like New Jersey. The sightings have been happening for months. US government agencies including the FBI, DHS and national security officials claim they have no idea who is behind this activity, even though drones have been seen operating over highly protected areas like US military bases.  There's a lot of information to be gleaned here if you know what you're looking for. I have written extensively about drones and drone warfare in my survival newsletter over the years, primarily on new developments in the technology and ways for civilians to defeat that technology. However, I have also written on how civilians can use drones for their own self defense.  I know enough about tracking technology to say with relative certainly that officials are lying about the drones over New Jersey, and probably about most of the covert drone activity in other parts of the country. They know who is controlling these drones, and it's most likely our own government. What we are witnessing is some form of false flag in progress.  First and foremost, drones can indeed be tracked rather easily depending on where they fly. Remote signals going back to the operator can be tracked with the right equipment. The stronger the remote signal the easier it is to find the operator. In New Jersey, for example, US Air Force Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst partnered with AeroDefense, a local business specializing in tracking technology and drone detection, to produce a system to track drones across the installation as well as pinpoint perpetrators who fly them. They started this program back in 2020.  Drone company DJI, which controls around 90% of the consumer drone market, has their own proprietary drone tracking technology that can be purchased by governments and various agencies. There's likely dozens more companies out there right now producing similar products to the DJI tracking tech.  Under new FAA regulations instituted this year, all drones operating in US air space (except very small drones) are required to carry a Remote ID module which broadcasts operator information and location. Most drones now have Remote ID integrated into their software and removing it can be a pain. For example, DJI drones are basically no longer used by Ukrainian forces because the built-in Remote ID gives away their positions. They now build most of their drones from scratch.  There are ways around drone tracking (to a point). Remote ID spoofing devices can be built and programmed for as little as $20. These broadcasting modules can create the illusion of dozens of drones in the sky with false operator data included. Anyone trying to use Remote ID tracking to find you will have no idea which drones are real and which are fake.  Drone signal repeaters (which function much like ham radio repeaters) are not uncommon and are used in Ukraine by both sides to help confuse tracking attempts. Signal repeaters and antennas are easy to hide, and pinpointing an exact location is difficult. In Ukraine, trackers would simply find a general area where the antenna or operator might be and then hit it with artillery. If they only hit a repeater, then the operator is out about $200 and that's it.  The Russians use drones connected to long spools of fiber optic cable which allows them to send the devices into areas protecting by jamming. The direct connection also keeps the operators from being tracked.  Then there are drones with AI software which bypass a lot of tracking tools. If the drone is controlling itself then there's no operator signal to trace. The drone might be broadcasting a video signal but that's not going to give up the location of the people who deployed the drone.  Most of these techniques would never be used by common civilians or even small terror groups (AI flight software in particular would only be used by governments). On top of that, access to large drones or car-sized drones is very rare for civilians and requires extensive permits. The cost of such devices is prohibitive (tens-of-thousands or hundreds-of-thousands of dollars depending on the drone).  My point is, there is no way civilian operators or small terror groups are behind the majority of these events. The level of sophistication involved here requires military or government agency oversight. Beyond that, there aren't enough countermeasures in the world to prevent tracking over sensitive government locations. The US military and DHS have extensive means to track down drones (especially large drones) flying in close proximity to bases and protected sites.  Triangulation would not be hard given the drone operators would have to fly through the middle of multiple detection equipped facilities. And, even if the drones are AI operated, large drones are not very fast or nimble. They could be followed without much trouble by helicopters or other drones.  Lack of public knowledge on this issue is being exploited by government officials and the media. I have seen multiple agency representatives claim that there's "not enough restrictions in place" to keep the threat of domestic drones in check. I have also seen government reps claim these drones are being operated by a foreign enemy like Iran. Recently, at least two men were arrested for flying a small drone too close to an airport in Chicago - Federal agencies and the media have tried to link these men to the covert drone sighting across the country when it's likely they have nothing to do with the situation.  Misinformation like this suggests an attempt to pin the drone activity on civilian sources, or, a foreign adversary working with civilian sources. In other words, they are preparing the ground for one of two outcomes: More aggressive restrictions on civilian drones, or, an drone attack that is blamed on a foreign government.  The size of the drones is what worries me most. If the goal of a foreign government was to monitor sensitive sites and collect information, they wouldn't use car-sized drones.

Under new FAA regulations instituted this year, all drones operating in US air space (except very small drones) are required to carry a Remote ID module which broadcasts operator information and location. Most drones now have Remote ID integrated into their software and removing it can be a pain. For example, DJI drones are basically no longer used by Ukrainian forces because the built-in Remote ID gives away their positions. They now build most of their drones from scratch.  There are ways around drone tracking (to a point). Remote ID spoofing devices can be built and programmed for as little as $20. These broadcasting modules can create the illusion of dozens of drones in the sky with false operator data included. Anyone trying to use Remote ID tracking to find you will have no idea which drones are real and which are fake.  Drone signal repeaters (which function much like ham radio repeaters) are not uncommon and are used in Ukraine by both sides to help confuse tracking attempts. Signal repeaters and antennas are easy to hide, and pinpointing an exact location is difficult. In Ukraine, trackers would simply find a general area where the antenna or operator might be and then hit it with artillery. If they only hit a repeater, then the operator is out about $200 and that's it.  The Russians use drones connected to long spools of fiber optic cable which allows them to send the devices into areas protecting by jamming. The direct connection also keeps the operators from being tracked.  Then there are drones with AI software which bypass a lot of tracking tools. If the drone is controlling itself then there's no operator signal to trace. The drone might be broadcasting a video signal but that's not going to give up the location of the people who deployed the drone.  Most of these techniques would never be used by common civilians or even small terror groups (AI flight software in particular would only be used by governments). On top of that, access to large drones or car-sized drones is very rare for civilians and requires extensive permits. The cost of such devices is prohibitive (tens-of-thousands or hundreds-of-thousands of dollars depending on the drone).  My point is, there is no way civilian operators or small terror groups are behind the majority of these events. The level of sophistication involved here requires military or government agency oversight. Beyond that, there aren't enough countermeasures in the world to prevent tracking over sensitive government locations. The US military and DHS have extensive means to track down drones (especially large drones) flying in close proximity to bases and protected sites.  Triangulation would not be hard given the drone operators would have to fly through the middle of multiple detection equipped facilities. And, even if the drones are AI operated, large drones are not very fast or nimble. They could be followed without much trouble by helicopters or other drones.  Lack of public knowledge on this issue is being exploited by government officials and the media. I have seen multiple agency representatives claim that there's "not enough restrictions in place" to keep the threat of domestic drones in check. I have also seen government reps claim these drones are being operated by a foreign enemy like Iran. Recently, at least two men were arrested for flying a small drone too close to an airport in Chicago - Federal agencies and the media have tried to link these men to the covert drone sighting across the country when it's likely they have nothing to do with the situation.  Misinformation like this suggests an attempt to pin the drone activity on civilian sources, or, a foreign adversary working with civilian sources. In other words, they are preparing the ground for one of two outcomes: More aggressive restrictions on civilian drones, or, an drone attack that is blamed on a foreign government.  The size of the drones is what worries me most. If the goal of a foreign government was to monitor sensitive sites and collect information, they wouldn't use car-sized drones. Large drones would be too easy to trace. They would use small mid-range drones outfitted with thermal that fit in a backpack.  But, our own government could fly fleets of large drones over cites and military bases with impunity. If our government wanted to, say, blow up a sacrificial military facility, damage a nuclear power plant or hit a civilian center, car-sized drones would be very useful because they are designed to carry considerable weight. Drones like those sighted over New Jersey could carry 500-1000 pounds of ordnance (maybe more). A swarm of these drones could cause total havoc in a heavily populated area.  I worry about this outcome because the Biden Administration and the globalist establishment have been very active in the past several months trying to create as many ignition points for world war as they possibly can before Donald Trump takes office in January. A false flag at this time makes perfect sense.  My second theory is based on the strange comments by defense officials linking the activity to lack of restrictions on the civilian drone market. As noted, there is NO WAY civilians are flying car-sized drones in US airspace over protected sites without being followed. The drones are too expensive, too big to move around without people noticing and that kind of operation requires insider knowledge of DoD and DHS tracking methods.  Some have speculated that there may be an agenda to get legislation (like a new Patriot Act) passed in the near future. I believe this may be a ploy to get traction on legislation restricting or banning civilian ownership of drones. Some people might be skeptical about that idea, but consider for a moment how useful drones are to a potential populist rebellion...  For over a century, governments and national armies have had a monopoly on aerial surveillance and the ability to engage enemies from the sky. With the invention of drones many patriots and survivalists have viewed the technology as the biggest threat to future attempts at rebellion against the establishment. The devices are cheap to produce, can operate in forests and urban environments and even small drones can carry enough explosives to maim or possibly kill with precision.  In the past, smaller forces using asymmetric tactics could still gain the upper hand against governments, even when fighting an advanced military with air superiority. Drones are now treated as the end game for insurgencies. But the truth is quite the opposite; drones are the end game for standard armies and a huge advantage for asymmetric rebellions. Drones are the biggest game changer in warfare for civilians since the invention of the repeating rifle.  We have seen the face of combat change dramatically in the war in Ukraine as drones become increasingly vital for both sides. Medium-sized drones have disrupted typical maneuver warfare tactics using high explosives to disable armored columns. Small drones allow operators to monitor the battlefield from the sky for miles and make discreet troop movements impossible.  Drones can be easily used by civilians for the same purposes. For the first time ever, patriots have access to the air for surveillance and defense. I would not be surprised to see governments fabricate reasons why the technology "needs to be banned" - They will try to sell the American people on the idea that drones are a danger to public safety, even if that requires bankrolling a terror attack to frighten people into compliance.  In either case - A trigger for WWIII or a test case for banning the civilian drone market, the establishment gains an advantage. As far as I can tell, no one else benefits from these drone incidents. All signs point to a false flag. If this reality is exposed widely enough, I expect that the government will finally admit that they were behind the drone flights, but only as an effort to "protect the public" from an insidious threat that they could not tell us about beforehand.<br><b>Location:</b> New Jersey<br><b>Date:</b> 2024-12-16T19:09:49Z<br><b>Source:</b> Infowars<br></div>`)[0];

Haseloff said that at least 200 more people were injured when a car plowed into festive market-goers in the eastern German city, around 75 miles west of the capital Berlin.  A young child and an adult were among those killed in the attack, according to Haseloff. At least 40 of those injured were so seriously hurt that their lives are still thought to be in danger, according to a Chancellor Olaf Scholz.  A suspect -- a doctor from Saudi Arabia aged around 50 -- was arrested, Haselhoff said. The man has lived in Germany since 2006. A rental car was used in the attack, the minister said.  MORE: At least 2 dead, nearly 70 injured when car plows into German Christmas market: Officials  The motive is unknown at this time, U.S. sources said. But U.S. law enforcement sources told ABC News that German authorities are treating the attack as a terrorist incident.  "We send our deepest condolences to the families and loved ones of those killed and injured and to all those affected by this terrible incident," State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said in a statement.  "We stand in solidarity with the people of Germany in grieving the loss of life. The United States is ready to provide assistance as recovery efforts continue and authorities investigate this horrible incident," Miller's statement continued.  Scholz offered his condolences to those affected. "My thoughts are with the victims and their families," Scholz said in a statement. "We stand by their side and by the side of the people of Magdeburg. My thanks go to the dedicated rescue workers in these anxious hours."  Friday's ramming incident came almost exactly eight years after a similar terror attack at a Christmas market in the German capital. On Dec. 19, 2016, a man drove a truck into a crowd at a market in Berlin, killing 13 and injuring dozens.  U.S. law enforcement officials have warned of similar vehicle-ramming attacks on American soil, particularly over the festive season.  A joint threat assessment about New Year's Eve in New York City's Times Square, for example, noted the use of vehicle-ramming alone or in conjunction with other tactics "has become a recurring tactic employed by threat actors in the West."  The NYPD, out of an abundance of caution, will surge resources to similar areas around the city, including Christmas markets, according to NYPD deputy commissioner for counterterrorism Rebecca Weiner.  "We know this is a very festive time, it is a busy time in the city, and we are going to make sure that all of our holiday markets, all of our holiday activities are protected by our counter weapons teams, by officers on patrol, all our counter-terrorism officers, our critical response command," Weiner told ABC New York station WABC.<br><b>Location:</b> Magdeburg<br><b>Date:</b> 2024-12-21T13:12:12Z<br><b>Source:</b> Yahoo<br></div>`)[0];

President Biden is expected to announce Tuesday that the U.S. and France secured a ceasefire in Lebanon, ending the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah, according to a U.S. official.  The full and permanent ceasefire would end the deadliest war in Lebanon since its civil war ended in 1990.  Under the deal, a full and permanent ceasefire would be implemented immediately. There will be 60 days permitted for the full withdrawal of Israeli forces -- a gradual withdrawal to allow the Lebanese forces to mobilize and move in to secure the area, but the trigger time is immediate, set to take effect later Tuesday.  The first peel-off of Israeli troops was to begin within the next 10 days.  Hezbollah is expected to pull its forces and heavy weapons back about 20 miles from the Israeli border, to the Litani River.  An official in Netanyahu's office told CBS News that the prime minister had convened the country's security cabinet to discuss the proposal. The cabinet must approve any ceasefire agreement. Netanyahu was also holding meetings Tuesday in Tel Aviv with various government ministers, lawmakers, and mayors from some of the northern towns that have been evacuated for months.  Lebanon's government also had to unilaterally approve the deal on Tuesday, but the U.S. official said that was expected.  Netanyahu was to address his country at 8 p.m. local time (1 p.m. Eastern) on Tuesday, according to his office, with President Biden then delivering remarks about the agreement in Washington within a few hours.  Hezbollah, a powerful military and political entity in Lebanon that has long been designated a terrorist group by both the U.S. and Israel, started firing rockets into Israel on Oct. 8, 2023, in support of its Hamas allies who sparked the war in Gaza with their terror attack the previous day.  Israel carried out airstrikes on purported Hezbollah targets for months, but in September it dramatically escalated its assault on the Iranian proxy group, including by launching ground operations in the south of Lebanon.  CBS News correspondent Debora Patta said rockets were still flying in both directions over Israel's northern border on Tuesday, with Israel and Hezbollah trading some of their heaviest fire to date, even as diplomats push for peace.  Under the proposed deal, Lebanese forces and United Nations peacekeepers are expected to jointly patrol southern Lebanon to ensure the terms of the agreement are adhered to. Earlier reports suggested the southern region would be monitored by a multi-nation committee, which would include both the U.S. and France.  Middle East expert Danny Citrinowicz, a fellow at the Atlantic Council think tank, said the deal looked "good on paper," but added that until it was implemented, "it would be hard to know whether Israel can really build on these kind of guarantees coming from the U.S. administration."  After more than a year of crossfire, more than 1.2 million people have been displaced from their homes in Lebanon, along with at least 60,000 from towns and villages in northern Israel. They're all desperate to go home, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has long said the chief objective of the war with Hezbollah, from his government's standpoint, has been to enable them to do so.  While a deal with Hezbollah appeared closer than ever, negotiations for a ceasefire in Israel's war with Iran's other proxy force in the Gaza Strip, Hamas - have gone nowhere.  Many in the decimated Palestinian territory are hungry, and recent rainstorms have made living conditions there even worse. A winter chill has set in, and there were reports of a fresh Israeli strike killing about 15 people Tuesday in Gaza City.<br><b>Location:</b> Lebanon<br><b>Date:</b> 2024-11-26T17:06:01Z<br><b>Source:</b> CBS News<br></div>`)[0];

Unconfirmed social media reports also suggest that Assad's plane crashed.  The sudden collapse of the Assad regime, dating back over half a century to the rule of Hafez al-Assad, Bashar's father, has rocked the Middle East and could mean the Iranian regime, a Syrian ally, is in danger.  Assad was one of the most notorious tyrants in the world, one who used chemical weapons against his own people. His regime nearly fell in the civil war that erupted during the Arab Spring in 2011, but he was shored up by Russian and Iranian forces.  President Vladimir Putin used Syria to restore Russia's presence in the Middle East for the first time since the Cold War, while Iran used Syria as a conduit to Hezbollah in Lebanon, sending weapons and advisers.  Assad had bombed rebel-held cities with no regard for civilian life, and torturing suspected rebels and dissidents. President Barack Obama drew a "red line" in 2012 when he said the U.S. would intervene militarily if Assad used chemical weapons, but then failed to act.  President Donald Trump launched airstrikes against the regime in 2017 after a chemical weapons attack, firing nearly 60 cruise missiles at Syrian air bases, which had the intended effect.  Trump reduced the U.S. troop presence in Syria, though small forces remained to counter threats from the so-called "Islamic State," or ISIS, which still operated in the country. Turkey also had an interest in Syria, targeting Kurdish militias operating in Syrian territory.  But Assad remained in power, thanks to Russia and Iran. Iran used Hezbollah forces from Lebanon to defend the regime, and they were accused of carrying out atrocities against Sunni regions.  The Syrian rebels -- including radical Islamist forces affiliated with Al Qaeda -- remained relatively weak. But the Third Lebanon War, which Hezbollah started by firing at Israeli cities after the Hamas terror attack of October 7, 2023, saw Hezbollah weakened and its supply lines disrupted.  In the wake of the ceasefire in Lebanon, the Syrian rebels, emboldened by Hezbollah's apparent defeat, began making rapid advances, meeting with little resistance.  Russia, tied down by the war in Ukraine, was apparently unable (or unwilling) to intervene. Iran reportedly sent new military advisers, but also evacuated Iranian militias and personnel from the country.  Assad was reported to have pulled his forces back to Damascus for a last stand, but there were reports of defections from his army as the rebels approached. The rebels appear to have used social media successfully to project strength and encourage surrender.  There were concerns about the fate of Assad's chemical weapons stockpile, which a deal brokered by Obama was supposed to have eliminated (but did not). There were unconfirmed reports that Israel had recently attacked a chemical weapons depot in Syria in an attempt to prevent the materials from falling into rebel hands. The rebels, according to social media reports, have claimed they will not use such weapons; their credibility is uncertain at best.  There are also concerns about the fate of religious minorities in Syria, particularly Christians. Israel has taken steps to reinforce its military presence on the Syrian border, warning the rebels not to attack it. President-elect Donald Trump said Saturday that the U.S. should stay out of Syria, and the Biden administration said it has no plans to intervene.  For now, the world waits to learn Assad's fate; to see who Syria's new rulers will be; and to see whether Iran is next.<br><b>Location:</b> Damascus<br><b>Date:</b> 2024-12-08T05:02:49Z<br><b>Source:</b> Breitbart<br></div>`)[0];

An official in Netanyahu's office told CBS News that the prime minister had convened the country's security cabinet to discuss the proposal. The cabinet must approve any ceasefire agreement. Netanyahu was also holding meetings Tuesday in Tel Aviv with various government ministers, lawmakers, and mayors from some of the northern towns that have been evacuated for months.  Lebanon's government also had to unilaterally approve the deal on Tuesday, but the U.S. official said that was expected.  Netanyahu was to address his country at 8 p.m. local time (1 p.m. Eastern) on Tuesday, according to his office, with President Biden then delivering remarks about the agreement in Washington within a few hours.  Hezbollah, a powerful military and political entity in Lebanon that has long been designated a terrorist group by both the U.S. and Israel, started firing rockets into Israel on Oct. 8, 2023, in support of its Hamas allies who sparked the war in Gaza with their terror attack the previous day.  Israel carried out airstrikes on purported Hezbollah targets for months, but in September it dramatically escalated its assault on the Iranian proxy group, including by launching ground operations in the south of Lebanon.  CBS News correspondent Debora Patta said rockets were still flying in both directions over Israel's northern border on Tuesday, with Israel and Hezbollah trading some of their heaviest fire to date, even as diplomats push for peace.  Under the proposed deal, Lebanese forces and United Nations peacekeepers are expected to jointly patrol southern Lebanon to ensure the terms of the agreement are adhered to. Earlier reports suggested the southern region would be monitored by a multi-nation committee, which would include both the U.S. and France.  Middle East expert Danny Citrinowicz, a fellow at the Atlantic Council think tank, said the deal looked "good on paper," but added that until it was implemented, "it would be hard to know whether Israel can really build on these kind of guarantees coming from the U.S. administration."  After more than a year of crossfire, more than 1.2 million people have been displaced from their homes in Lebanon, along with at least 60,000 from towns and villages in northern Israel. They're all desperate to go home, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has long said the chief objective of the war with Hezbollah, from his government's standpoint, has been to enable them to do so.  While a deal with Hezbollah appeared closer than ever, negotiations for a ceasefire in Israel's war with Iran's other proxy force in the Gaza Strip, Hamas - have gone nowhere.  Many in the decimated Palestinian territory are hungry, and recent rainstorms have made living conditions there even worse. A winter chill has set in, and there were reports of a fresh Israeli strike killing about 15 people Tuesday in Gaza City.<br><b>Location:</b> Lebanon<br><b>Date:</b> 2024-11-26T17:06:01Z<br><b>Source:</b> CBS News<br></div>`)[0];

Nallah Sutherland, a special event coordinator for the Mayor's Office of Special Projects and Community Events, was spotted earlier this month tearing down the poster from an Upper East Side light pole, ripping it up and dumping it in a trash bin, according to video posted online by the nonprofit StopAntisemetism.  "It's an appalling act of antisemitism," said the nonprofit's founder Liora Rez, who demanded Adams immediately fire Sutherland.  But Sutherland, 25, only got a slap on the wrist by her bosses -- who merely required her to take "multicultural training" and added a disciplinary note to her permanent work file, a City Hall source told The Post.  Footage of the Nov. 2 incident at the corner of York Ave and East 84th Street begins with Sutherland tearing off the poster and tossing it in the trash.  "Is there a reason you're taking those down?" asks an eyewitness about the poster, part of a public art campaign to raise awareness of Israeli and American hostages taken captive by Hamas during its Oct. 7, 2023 terror attack on the Jewish state.  "Those were hostages. They were taken by terrorists," adds the eyewitness, according to the 20-second clip he recorded.  Sutherland then walks toward the man and swipes his phone with her right hand, briefly knocking it out of focus, the video shows.  "That's assault actually. You know that, right?" the man responds to Sutherland, who smirks and walks away, the video shows.  Sutherland began working for Adams - a staunch Israel supporter - in 2023. She earns $61,135-a-year helping plan celebrations he hosts at Gracie Mansion and at other sites to honor the diverse city's many ethnic groups, records show.  She's part of a team whose job is to "bridge cultural divides ... and support key city initiatives that help provide a source of strength, unity, and resilience to New Yorkers across all communities within the five boroughs and beyond," according to her office's website.  In May, the office organized a Jewish heritage celebration hosted by Adams at Gracie Mansion. The guest speakers included Shoshan Haran, who along with her daughter and two grandchildren, were taken hostage by Hamas and released 50 days later.  "It's extremely hypocritical that someone who supports the murder of anyone still has a job, much less in a department that plays a vital role in our city's diversity efforts -- despite the fact that she cannot tolerate innocent Jews who were kidnapped by Hamas," said Councilwoman Inna Vernikov (R-Brooklyn) after being told about Sutherland's action.  "Decisive action must be taken to purge this disgusting pro-jihadist sentiment from" city government "once and for all," added Vernikov, who is Jewish.  The eyewitness, who is Jewish and didn't report the incident to authorities, wants to remain anonymous out of fear of retribution considering antisemitism cases are soaring statewide.  "It's a sad state of affairs when the victim doesn't have trust in the NYPD or" soft-on-crime Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg "to properly investigate" hate crimes," said Rez. "There's no trust in the authorities to keep the victim safe."  City Hall first leaned about the incident weeks ago when a tipster recognized Sutherland after watching the video posted on StopAntisemetism's social media accounts, said a source.  The same "multicultural training" Sutherland received will also now be mandatory for all Mayor's Office of Special Projects and Community Events staff to prevent similar hateful behavior in the future, said the City Hall source.  Sutherland is a "junior staffer" who doesn't directly communicate with Adams as part of her duties, added the source.  "Mayor Adams has been clear that hate has no place in our city, and the same - if not higher - standard should be held for our city's more than 300,000 employees," the Mayor's Office said.  "That is why disciplinary action was taken immediately after learning about this incident a few weeks ago."  "It is especially disturbing to learn that an individual employed by the mayor's office -- particularly in a position meant to celebrate the city's diversity -- is directly connected to this culture of hate," he said.<br><b>Location:</b> New York City<br><b>Date:</b> 2024-11-30T16:20:05Z<br><b>Source:</b> New York Post<br></div>`)[0];

But Sutherland, 25, only got a slap on the wrist by her bosses -- who merely required her to take "multicultural training" and added a disciplinary note to her permanent work file, a City Hall source told The Post.  Footage of the Nov. 2 incident at the corner of York Ave and East 84th Street begins with Sutherland tearing off the poster and tossing it in the trash.  "Is there a reason you're taking those down?" asks an eyewitness about the poster, part of a public art campaign to raise awareness of Israeli and American hostages taken captive by Hamas during its Oct. 7, 2023 terror attack on the Jewish state.  "Those were hostages. They were taken by terrorists," adds the eyewitness, according to the 20-second clip he recorded.  Sutherland then walks toward the man and swipes his phone with her right hand, briefly knocking it out of focus, the video shows.  "That's assault actually. You know that, right?" the man responds to Sutherland, who smirks and walks away, the video shows.  Sutherland began working for Adams - a staunch Israel supporter - in 2023. She earns $61,135-a-year helping plan celebrations he hosts at Gracie Mansion and at other sites to honor the diverse city's many ethnic groups, records show.  She's part of a team whose job is to "bridge cultural divides ... and support key city initiatives that help provide a source of strength, unity, and resilience to New Yorkers across all communities within the five boroughs and beyond," according to her office's website.  In May, the office organized a Jewish heritage celebration hosted by Adams at Gracie Mansion. The guest speakers included Shoshan Haran, who along with her daughter and two grandchildren, were taken hostage by Hamas and released 50 days later.  "It's extremely hypocritical that someone who supports the murder of anyone still has a job, much less in a department that plays a vital role in our city's diversity efforts -- despite the fact that she cannot tolerate innocent Jews who were kidnapped by Hamas," said Councilwoman Inna Vernikov (R-Brooklyn) after being told about Sutherland's action.  "Decisive action must be taken to purge this disgusting pro-jihadist sentiment from" city government "once and for all," added Vernikov, who is Jewish.  The eyewitness, who is Jewish and didn't report the incident to authorities, wants to remain anonymous out of fear of retribution considering antisemitism cases are soaring statewide.  "It's a sad state of affairs when the victim doesn't have trust in the NYPD or" soft-on-crime Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg "to properly investigate" hate crimes," said Rez. "There's no trust in the authorities to keep the victim safe."  City Hall first leaned about the incident weeks ago when a tipster recognized Sutherland after watching the video posted on StopAntisemetism's social media accounts, said a source.  The same "multicultural training" Sutherland received will also now be mandatory for all Mayor's Office of Special Projects and Community Events staff to prevent similar hateful behavior in the future, said the City Hall source.  Sutherland is a "junior staffer" who doesn't directly communicate with Adams as part of her duties, added the source.  "Mayor Adams has been clear that hate has no place in our city, and the same - if not higher - standard should be held for our city's more than 300,000 employees," the Mayor's Office said.  "That is why disciplinary action was taken immediately after learning about this incident a few weeks ago."  "It is especially disturbing to learn that an individual employed by the mayor's office -- particularly in a position meant to celebrate the city's diversity -- is directly connected to this culture of hate," he said.<br><b>Location:</b> New York City<br><b>Date:</b> 2024-11-30T16:20:05Z<br><b>Source:</b> New York Post<br></div>`)[0];

Drone Mystery Could Be Covert Operation Searching For Device<br><b>Event body:</b> Globalists desperate to disrupt Trump peace negotiations ahead of inauguration.  According multiple Infowars sources as well as whistleblowers posting online, the mysterious fleets of drones being sighted around the United States in recent weeks may be searching for a nuclear weapon that has been smuggled into the country.  The CEO of Saxon Aerospace John Ferguson recently posted a viral TikTok video claiming he knows a person who had knowledge of an old "nuclear warhead" left over from Ukraine by Moscow after the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union.  "I spoke to a gentleman a few months ago, who was trying to raise the alarm to the highest levels of our government...about this one particular nuclear warhead that he physically put his hands on...that was left over from Ukraine...and he knew this thing was headed towards the United States," Ferguson said.  He continued to assess that the drones being sighted on the East Coast are trying to look for radioactive materials, and pointed out the Biden administration is "pushing to get into war with Russia," suggesting a nuke set off in the U.S. could be blamed on the Vladimir Putin-led nation.  Infowars founder Alex Jones commented on the post, writing, "The American's information below is 100% correct. But there is a catch. He is only 100% right about one component. I have been waiting over the last week until I think through the second and third order consequences of telling you what I know. Stand by for the information today. If you ever ignored my warnings in the past and later, wished you would have listened, you want to pay attention now..."  After top podcast host Joe Rogan said Ferguson's video is the first take on the drones that has him "genuinely concerned," Jones replied, "I have confirmed with my sources in USNORTHCOM that this is indeed the purported reason the drones are swarming the NJ/NY area. But there is a lot more to it. I am headed in to the office to shoot a report that will be released today."  As Ferguson's video exploded online, another thread caught the internet's eye as an 𝕏 user called JerseyFutures claiming to be an RF engineer, who has since deleted the account, also alleged the drones are American-made aircraft trying to detect the presence of nuclear radiation from miles away.  The post suggested the U.S. military drones may be looking for a "dirty bomb" around New York.  Meanwhile, the Geiger Counter World Map, which is currently experiencing off and on server issues, has been showing concerning radiation counts on the East Coast.  Confirming the drones are active in New York, Democrat NY Governor Kathy Hochul issued a statement on Saturday revealing the aircraft caused "runways at Stewart Airfield" to be "shut down for approximately one hour," adding, "This has gone too far."  Now, with the chatter that Russia could be blamed in a scenario where a bomb from Ukraine was smuggled into the U.S., it's worth going back to 2022 statements from Russia warning a nuclear false flag could be carried out and blamed on the Kremlin.  In March 2022, Ukraine's Director of Institute for Safety Problems of Nuclear Power Plants (ISPNPP), Anatolii Nosovskyi, warned that looters allegedly stole radioactive isotopes that could be used to make a "dirty bomb" after Russia gained control over the Chernobyl monitoring lab.  Just weeks prior to Nosovskyi's accusation, Russia's Ambassador to Iraq Elbrus Kutrashev said fears of Ukraine deploying a dirty bomb against Russia were a leading factor in the decision to invade Ukraine in the first place.  "Nuclear. [They planned to use] nuclear waste in a bomb, and attack Russia or Russian interests, or maybe a concentration of Russians," he said. "This forced us to choose as a priority of our special operation in Ukraine taking control of the nuclear plant in Chernobyl. We accomplished this successfully at the beginning of the operation."  Alex Jones' 2022 analysis:  The Western mainstream narrative at the time was that Putin allowed the materials to be stolen, which is unconfirmed, in order to engage in a "false flag" dirty bomb attack against Russia.  Moscow has repeatedly warned Western nations about Kiev's alleged plans to use a "dirty bomb" in Ukraine to frame Russia.  Of course, with the CIA and NATO using Ukraine as a proxy army, it is the West that would be behind the dirty bomb plot if Kiev was "behind" an attack.  In July of this year, United Kingdom Parliament Member Andrew Bridgen claimed NATO and other parties were planning a false flag attack on a European city by detonating a nuclear "dirty bomb" to be blamed on Russia and launch WWIII.  Iran could also be blamed for the attack, as Republican Congressman Jefferson Van Drew of New Jersey claimed earlier this month that the New Jersey drones are being launched from an Iranian "mothership" stationed off the East Coast of the United States.  With President-elect Donald Trump set to take office for his second term, is it possible the Deep State scheme to detonate a dirty bomb in Ukraine or Europe was altered to now take place in New York or Washington D.C. in order to disrupt his presidency?  The American political establishment could even try to take Trump out (again) and come in as the saviors, telling the public the drones were trying to keep them safe from the dirty bomb threat and promising retaliation on whoever they blame.  Related: Multiple Sources Now Confirm Infowars Reports Of Surface-To-Air Missiles Inside US To Target Trump Force One  America's wide-open borders sure would make it easy for nefarious actors to enter the country with a warhead and carry out a terror attack, especially if assisted by globalists inside the U.S. government.  Dr. Naomi Wolf warned the Infowars audience just last month that the desperate Deep State may soon launch a nuclear attack inside America in order to disrupt the incoming Trump administration.<br><b>Location:</b> New York<br><b>Date:</b> 2024-12-15T20:03:20Z<br><b>Source:</b> Infowars<br></div>`)[0];

The who, in particular, and the why.  For some, like Renaud Camus, the man who actually coined the term "the Great Replacement," mass demographic change in the West is not the product of any kind of conspiracy. There is no "who" as such directing the importation of hordes of Third World people into the nations of Europe, North America and the Anglosphere.  Instead, for Camus, the Great Replacement is simply the result of the spread of a way of thinking he terms "replaceism": a belief that, ultimately, all people are just interchangeable and therefore there is no such thing as, say, genuine national or ethnic identity that should or even could be preserved.  We might call a variant of this the "magic soil" theory of identity. There is nothing, nothing apart from an official legal process, that can stop a Nigerian who lands in France or the UK from becoming French or British or Welsh or even, like me, Cornish.  Camus sees "replaceism" as emerging and growing due to the profound social, economic and spiritual changes of the modern era -- everything from the Reformation and the Enlightenment to the spread of industrialisation, capitalism, mass democracy, mass education and mass entertainment.  The television is as much to blame as any politician.  The "why" that follows from this de-centered "who" is clearly also de-centered. "Replaceism" is the logic of the modern liberal world. It's unavoidable. There isn't any malice behind it. It has terrible effects, of course, and it's destroying the West, but the will behind it is blind and unfeeling.  It's not personal, however much you might hate it.  Many people who criticize or fête Camus don't actually seem to know this: that he identifies no single group that is to blame, even if he holds politicians and the media in deep contempt -- as he, and we, should -- for their cowardice and self-serving behaviour. People who describe Camus as a racist or white supremacist or even right wing usually tend to ignore what he's actually saying.  The opposite tendency -- well, we know what that looks like, don't we? An identifiable group and a clear sense of malice towards the people of the West. Often, that group is said to be some tribe of wandering desert folk, like the Bedouin or the Bakhtiari nomads of Iran. These people, from a deep historical antipathy for settled agricultural peoples and in particular Christians, have decided to subvert and overthrow their societies and civilisation from within.  This account, by contrast, is very personal.  Everywhere we look, at all the institutions that are bringing on the Great Replacement -- from the government departments and the think-tanks to the religious NGOs bussing migrants and the universities indoctrinating Westerners to hate themselves, their culture and their history, not to mention the companies sapping the younger generation's desire to reproduce with porn, dating apps and parasocial smut websites like OnlyFans -- everywhere we look we detect the sandy fingers and the mint-yoghurt smell of a Bedouin or some such. Or so the theory goes.  The implication, of course, is that any attempt to reverse mass immigration and mass demographic change must therefore focus on this group primarily, on dislodging them from their secret control of the West.  The truth, I think, is somewhere in between. We absolutely must reckon with enormous impersonal changes that have taken place and made it possible to think a Nigerian can become a Briton simply on the basis of a citizenship test. The way we think about nationality and identity has changed tremendously, and it has changed tremendously over a long span of time, centuries in fact, without any obvious direction except its own inner logic, which draws its sources, as Camus shows, from many different places and things.  At the same time, though, we should also be alive to the genuine malice and wilfulness that seem to motivate official policies of mass immigration in Western nations.  As a Brit, I well remember the shocking revelations made by Andrew Neather, a former advisor to Tony Blair's New Labour government, which was responsible for introducing mass immigration to Britain beginning in 1997. In about 2010, Neather told a British newspaper that the policy had been specifically formulated to "rub the right's nose in diversity" and change the social fabric of Britain forever, so that a truly conservative government could never again be elected.  There was outcry at the time, and official denials, but why would Neather have made it up? He was simply being honest. Peter Mandelson, a New Labour grandee, said the government actually sent search parties out to Eastern Europe to get people to come to the UK, despite the fact they weren't really needed to fill jobs in the economy.  If you're an American, or even an observer from the other side of the Pond like me, it's hard to look at what happened in Springfield, Ohio or Charleroi, Pennsylvania or across the entire nation since 2021 and not see a deliberate plan to displace real Americans with foreigners, for political purposes (winning the election) at the very least.  But there's malice too, no doubt. The absurd, grotesque spectacle of 20,000 cat-eating Haitians being dumped in a small Midwest town bespeaks, to me, a deep hatred of actual Americans that is confirmed by everything else the Biden admin has done for the last four years.  Anyway, I say all of this as a long prelude to the following observation, or rather question: Why is it that, as demographic replacement really begins to bite across the West, governments are so keen to bring in euthanasia services that will only be used by the natives?  From the outside, it certainly looks like an evil twist to me, but could it just be happenstance.  With the release of the latest figures from Canada, which has gone turbo-Great Replacement under its oleaginous Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, we do at least know that this is the case: that white people are the overwhelming constituency for legal euthanasia.  "Medically assisted dying" or "MAiD" is used almost entirely by white Canadians. Ninety-six percent of cases are white Canadians. White Canadians make up 67% of the population.  Canadian doctors are now killing 15,000 people a year, more or less all of them white. That's 5% of all deaths in a given year. Many of these people are poor and ill, abandoned by a government and a welfare system that are only too happy to accommodate people with no ties whatsoever to Canada -- to house, feed, employ and care for their health, on the basis of no prior relationship at all.  Some of those who seek MAiD are even veterans who have served Canada in the military. Instead of being offered wheelchair ramps for their homes and new prosthetics, they're offered a lethal injection.  If other Western countries that have legalised euthanasia -- Austria, the Netherlands, Spain, Belgium -- released statistics by ethnicity, I'm sure exactly the same pattern would be visible, just as starkly.  And it's not just older people either. As we know from the case of Shanti de Corte or more recently the Belgian woman known only as "Laura," it's young people too. Young people who despair at the state of the world and their countries, whether they know the real reasons for their despair or not. Shanti de Corte suffered PTSD after surviving an Islamist terror attack in Brussels.  To tell you the truth, I'm not sure what to make of this. But I do know it troubles me deeply. Malice or impersonal logic -- either way, it amounts to the same thing, and it's not good.<br><b>Location:</b> Western<br><b>Date:</b> 2024-12-16T19:40:36Z<br><b>Source:</b> Infowars<br></div>`)[0];
