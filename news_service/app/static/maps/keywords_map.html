Europe is awash with radical Muslims who wish death upon infidels, and Germany allowed hordes of these people into their country. At a local Christmas market in Magdeburg, one man, a reported Saudi Arabian, plowed through a crowd, killing at least several people and wounding as many as 60-80 others. We don't have official numbers yet (via NYT) [WARNING: Some graphic images]:  A driver rammed a vehicle into a Christmas market in the city of Magdeburg in central Germany on Friday evening, killing at least one person and wounding dozens of others, in what local officials said they suspected had been an attack.  The driver of the vehicle was arrested, according to local news reports.  At least of 68 people were wounded, 15 of them severely, said Michael Reif, the spokesman for the city of Magdeburg. Mr. Reif and a regional government spokesman, Matthias Schuppe, both said they suspected the episode had not been an accident, according to the German public broadcaster.  "This is a terrible event, especially now in the days leading up to Christmas," Reiner Haseloff, the governor of Saxony-Anhalt state, where Magdeburg is the capital, told the German wire service D.P.A.  More than 1,000 temporary Christmas markets pop up every year in Germany, and they have been the target of terrorists in the past. In 2016, an extremist rammed a truck into a crowd in Berlin, killing 13. Since then, the police have secured many Christmas markets with temporary barriers.  It's a terror attack, and the suspect isn't some "driver." That's the shameful part that's being omitted. The headlines read as if this vehicle got a life of its own, like something out of Stephen King's Christine. It was a Muslim man who decided he wanted to commit an act of radical Islamic terrorism. It's not just this incident.  When it comes to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and similar events, where terrorists try to run over Jews at bus stations, the Associated Press, one of the worst offenders of this trend, acts as if no one drove the cars. The suspect was also known to German security forces.<br><b>Location:</b> Magdeburg<br><b>Date:</b> 2024-12-20T21:24:07Z<br><b>Source:</b> Townhall<br></div>`)[0];

The perpetrator, J.C. Simon, who perceived Erakat to be a white man, entered the grocery store, greeted Erakat, and then ordered him to the bathroom in the back of the shop, demanded Erakat to kneel on his knees, tied his hands behind his back, and shot Erakat in the back of his head with a .32 caliber gun, using a quilt to muffle the gunshot sounds. Additionally, Simon emptied both the safe and the cash register, taking with him about $1300.  It came out in trial that the bloody hand print of Anthony C. Harris was also found at the crime scene inside the store.  The perpetrators were black Muslims who believed in the teachings of the Nation of Islam, and believed that they had to "destroy the enemy" and "kill devils," which they translated into meaning, kill whites.  The motives were racist in origins and a response to the racial rhetoric of the time.  This was the third in a series of 20 attacks (with 23 victims) on random whites by black muslims who came to be known as the Zebra Killers.<br><b>Location:</b> <br><b>Date:</b> 1982-01-25T00:00:00Z<br><b>Source:</b> <br></div>`)[0];

Rose was driving up to the entrance gate of the University of California at Berkeley extension center in her gold 1967 Ford Mustang, when she was approached by Cooks, who walked in front of her car, leaned on the window and asked for a ride.  Rose stepped on the accelerator at which point the two got into an argument, leading Cooks to shoot and kill Rose with a .22 caliber gun.   Cooks was caught by detectives, and confessed to the murder of Frances Rose the same night.  He was eventually convicted and sentenced to prison for her murder.  The motives were racist in origin and a response to the racial rhetoric of the time. This was the second in a series of 20 attacks  (with 23 victims) on random whites by black Muslims who came to be known as the Zebra Killers.<br><b>Location:</b> <br><b>Date:</b> 1974-12-19T00:00:00Z<br><b>Source:</b> <br></div>`)[0];

Rose was driving up to the entrance gate of the University of California at Berkeley extension center in her gold 1967 Ford Mustang, when she was approached by Cooks, who walked in front of her car, leaned on the window and asked for a ride.  Rose stepped on the accelerator at which point the two got into an argument, leading Cooks to shoot and kill Rose with a .22 caliber gun.

The bomb exploded in one of the coin-operated public lockers near the ticketing area of the terminal, and caused considerable damage including shattering several huge plate glass windows and leaving a 10 by 15 foot hole in the wall.  Kurbegovic apparently belonged to no organization and had no outside support; however, in a tape sent to the Herald-Examiner, he claimed he was the military officer of a group he called "Aliens of America."  Kurbegovic became known as the "alphabet bomber" because he picked his targets in alphabetical order.<br><b>Location:</b> <br><b>Date:</b> 1979-11-02T00:00:00Z<br><b>Source:</b> <br></div>`)[0];

Israel Hayom reported Sunday:  A senior Hamas official currently based in Turkey told Saudi media that the 37th anniversary of the terrorist organization's founding comes during a period of decline due to defeats in Gaza and the broader region.  The official disclosed, "Hamas is suffering from a genuine leadership crisis. The Al-Aqsa Flood attack backfired on us, submerging us in a sea of blood and crises. The most recent blow was the fall of Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria, with which Hamas had been attempting to rebuild relations."  According to a report by the Saudi news site Elaph, the Syrian government has ordered Palestinian terrorist groups to shut down their offices, hand over their weapons, dismantle training camps, and leave Syria as soon as possible. The primary Palestinian group active in Syria has been the Islamic Jihad. In contrast, Hamas's political bureau left Syria earlier due to its support for Islamist rebels at the start of the Syrian civil war, which sparked a rift with Assad.  Israel Hayom also cited reporting that Palestinian terrorists in Syria fled to Iran, but may leave for other countries due to the fear of assassination (Israel is suspected of having killed Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in July.)  There are also Hamas officials in Turkey, and some are in Qatar -- including some who reportedly returned there at the urging of the incoming Trump administration, solely for the purpose of negotiating a hotage deal by January 20.  The report that Hamas leaders are accepting that the October 7 terror attack was a strategic mistake is a reversal from past months, and suggests that Israel is succeeding in restoring a deterrent against its enemies.  However, there are European nations who continue to reward Hamas, with Ireland the latest to join South Africa's "genocide" case against Israel at the International Court of Justice. Ireland, Spain, and Norway also recognized a Palestinian state.<br><b>Location:</b> Turkey<br><b>Date:</b> 2024-12-15T19:03:02Z<br><b>Source:</b> Breitbart<br></div>`)[0];

As she sped up and reached her front door about to enter, the man approached her with a gun, forced her into a nearby dark parking lot, and raped her in the dirt area behind the bushes. During the incident, he told Linder that racism and oppression of black people needed to stop, and he threatened to kill her and told her that others would also be killed.   Then, he walked Linder home to make sure she would not call the police, and after talking more in her apartment, her raped her a second time in her bedroom. Linder survived and was eventually able to recover from the ordeal. The perpetrator was later identified as Jesse Lee Cooks, one of the eight men who came to be known as the Zebra killers, and this was the second of 20 attacks (with 23 victims) committed by the Zebra murderers, a group of black Muslims who belonged to the Nation of Islam religious sect.<br><b>Location:</b> <br><b>Date:</b> 2004-11-10T00:00:00Z<br><b>Source:</b> <br></div>`)[0];
