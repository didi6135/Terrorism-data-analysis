Dozens of casualties were reported after a car plowed into a large number of people at a Christmas market in the German city of Magdeburg on Friday night in what officials say is a likely terrorist attack.  Emergency services reported that at least 60 to 80 people were injured in the attack. German newspaper BILD reported that at least 11 people had died from their injuries in the attack.  BILD also reported that the attacker "is said to be a man from Saudi Arabia born in 1974."  The suspected driver of the vehicle, which drove down a street that was completely packed with people, was arrested shortly after the attack, officials said.  WARNING: The following videos contain graphic material.  While there was no immediate word about the identity of the attacker or a possible motive, law enforcement officials throughout Europe are often on high alert for Islamic terrorist attacks, especially around Christian and Jewish holidays.  CHECK OUT THE DAILY WIRE HOLIDAY GIFT GUIDE  The threats posed by Islamic terrorists around the world have surged following Hamas' October 7 terrorist attack in Israel last year.

The child was brought in critical condition to Hadassah Hospital Ein Kerem in nearby Jerusalem, where doctors declared his death early Thursday following intensive efforts to save him.  The boy was not immediately named. The Magen David Adom ambulance service identified him as a 12-year-old while the municipality of the Beitar Illit settlement -- where the bus departed from -- said in a statement that he was traveling home to Jerusalem with his family.  Three others were wounded in the shooting -- a woman with moderate wounds and two people who were lightly hurt.  The bus was shot up by the gunman at a junction by the Palestinian town of al-Khader, the Israel Defense Forces said, before proceeding with the wounded to the Tunnels Checkpoint.  The terrorist remains at large. The IDF announced troops were setting up roadblocks while encircling Bethlehem as part of the manhunt.  A video clip filmed shortly after the shooting showed passengers fleeing the bus after it arrived at the checkpoint, as security forces there rushed toward the vehicle amid the sound of gunfire. It was not clear from the footage where all the shots emanated from.  The attack came after three Israelis were lightly injured by gunfire the previous night while visiting Joseph's Tomb in the Palestinian city of Nablus without coordinating with the military, and also followed a car-ramming attack in the southern West Bank over the weekend in which a soldier was seriously wounded.  Violence has risen sharply in the West Bank since the Gaza war started on October 7, 2023, when thousands of Hamas-led terrorists stormed southern Israel to kill some 1,200 people and take 251 hostages.  Since then, 42 people, including Israeli security personnel, have been killed in terror attacks in Israel and the West Bank. Another six members of the security forces were killed in clashes with operatives in the West Bank amid a major counterterrorism offensive that has been accompanied by sharp restrictions on Palestinian movement.  Israeli troops have arrested some 5,250 wanted Palestinians across the West Bank as part of the post-October 7 military operations, including more than 2,050 affiliated with Hamas.  According to the Palestinian Authority health ministry, some 800 West Bank Palestinians have been killed in the same span of time. The IDF says the vast majority of them were gunmen killed in exchanges of fire, rioters who clashed with troops or terrorists carrying out attacks.<br><b>Location:</b> West Bank<br><b>Date:</b> 2024-12-12T02:56:39Z<br><b>Source:</b> timesofisrael.com<br></div>`)[0];

The man -- Taleb A., according to a report from The Guardian -- fled to Germany as a Saudi Arabian refugee in 2006 and gained official refugee status in 2016.  The 50-year-old left his home country due to its Islamic government and settled in Bernburg, where he worked as a doctor and psychotherapist after receiving his permanent status, according to the Wall Street Journal.  He was prominent in the Saudi community in Germany as an anti-Islam and women's rights activist -- running a website and social media channels dedicated to those causes, the Journal reports.  On his website, he warned prospective refugees to eschew Germany due to what he perceived as the government's tolerance of radical Islam.  The man also posted pro-Israel content in the wake of the Oct. 7 terror attack and was a supporter of Germany's rightwing anti-immigration party AfD, the newspaper reported.  In social media posts days before the attack, the suspect criticized the German government, claiming it was promoting the European nation's Islamization, and also alleged authorities were censoring him because of his views, according to The Wall Street Journal.  Taleb A. is accused of plowing his car through a crowded Christmas market in Madgeburg, injuring dozens and killing at least 2, including a small child, in what authorities are calling a suspected terror attack.  Police operations remain ongoing in Magdeburg and Bernburg, where the suspect lives, The Guardian reports.  The attack comes one day after the anniversary of the 2016 Berlin Christmas market attack that killed 12 people and injured 56 in the deadliest terror attack in German history.<br><b>Location:</b> Magdeburg<br><b>Date:</b> 2024-12-21T05:22:58Z<br><b>Source:</b> New York Post<br></div>`)[0];

The pro-Palestinian Bronx Anti-War Coalition, a self-described "working-class, BIPOC-led, anti-imperialist" group, organized a rally on Sunday in New York City's Union Square to express solidarity with the "Axis of Resistance," which the group identified as Hezbollah, Iran, Syria, Yemen, and the Iraqi "resistance."  At the event, a speaker donning a keffiyeh issued sharp proclamations, including: "Stop pointing fingers at each other. Our fingers, our pens, our rifles will be pointed at the U.S. government, the Zionist entity, and nobody else."  The rally featured chants repeated by the crowd, calling out "U.S. imperialists" as the "number one terrorists" and voicing unity with regional terror movements.  Participants were seen waving flags representing the Palestinians; Iran, the leading state sponsor of terror; Iraq, where Iranian-backed militias hold significant influence; Lebanon, home to Hezbollah; Syria under Assad's regime, notorious for brutal crackdowns during its civil war; and Yemen, where the Houthi rebels align with Iran.  These were seen alongside Hezbollah's yellow flag, a known emblem of armed resistance and Islamic terror.  Hezbollah, which has actively sought to expand its influence beyond the Middle East, is designated a terrorist organization by more than a dozen countries and international entities, including major Western nations, members of the European Union, and most Arab League member states, due to its involvement in terrorist activities against American, French, Israeli, and other targets.  Former President Donald Trump has denounced Hezbollah, stating, "No terrorist group other than al-Qaeda has more American blood on its hands." Meanwhile, Arkansas Republican Sen. Tom Cotton has called for the elimination of "all of Hezbollah's leadership" while insisting that the United States "should let Israel win" against Tehran's key terrorist proxy in the region.  The event also emphasized anti-sectarianism, with the speaker urging the crowd to "rise above religious differences" and focus on a shared cause.  The "anti-capitalism" Bronx Anti-War Coalition amplified their message on social media, sharing a video of Hamas spokesperson Abu Obeida denouncing sectarianism, as well as a speech by Hezbollah Secretary-General Naim Qassam streamed from Iran's Press TV.  In response, critics took to social media to express outrage over the rally's rhetoric.  "The day will come when these Palestine 'activists' inevitably execute a massive terror attack in NYC. And once they do, don't say we didn't warn you," wrote journalist Eitan Fischberger.  "Hey @RealTomHoman, here are some prime deportation candidates!" wrote conservative commentator Dave Rubin.  "It's never been about Israel, it's always been about destroying Western civilization," wrote activist Eyal Yakoby.  The matter comes as the trend of anti-American sentiment at pro-Palestinian events continues to grow.  According to world-renowned military historian and professor Dr. Victor Davis Hanson, Hamas's "death cult" relies on "useful Western idiots" to support the Palestinian cause, which has "fused with the leftwing DEI industry."  In addition, he predicted over a year ago that pro-Palestinian protests and support for Hamas in the U.S. have alienated many Americans and would all but ensure a tough conservative president in 2024.<br><b>Location:</b> New York<br><b>Date:</b> 2024-12-18T03:40:36Z<br><b>Source:</b> Breitbart<br></div>`)[0];

In a post on X, the AP shared an article with the title, "At least 2 dead and 60 hurt after a car drives into a German Christmas market in a suspected attack."  "A car has driven into a group of people at a Christmas market in Germany," the AP wrote in its post on X.  As Breitbart News's Kurt Zindulka reported, a man, who is "reportedly from Saudi Arabia" drove a car through "a crowd of people at a Christmas market" in the city of Magdeburg.  The community notes for the AP's post on X explains:  "A car has driven" implies the car drove itself, which is factually incorrect. A man from Saudi Arabia intentionally drove the car into the Christmas market as a terror attack.  Several people responded to the AP's post on X, questioning "who was driving the car" and criticizing the establishment media for writing "headlines like this" instead of being honest.  "The media likes to write headlines like this because instead of being honest about the driver being a terrorist, they hope you may just think it's one of those evil Elon Musk self driving cars acting up again," another person wrote in a post on X.  "'A car has driven into a group of people' might be one of the best possible examples of how the media has worked tirelessly to ensure that its importance and influence collapse," Ian Miller, a writer with Outkick wrote.<br><b>Location:</b> Magdeburg<br><b>Date:</b> 2024-12-21T03:19:02Z<br><b>Source:</b> Breitbart<br></div>`)[0];

Bryan Washko said that five people are injured and the suspect killed after he drove his car into the Killeen Mall in Texas on Saturday. (Credit: KWTX)  At least five people were injured, and a suspect was killed, after a man drove his pickup truck through the glass doors of a J.C. Penney in a mall in Texas, police said.  The incident happened on Saturday evening, just days before Christmas, at the Killeen Mall in Killeen, Texas - which is about 70 miles north of Austin.  In a press conference on Saturday evening, Texas Department of Public Safety Sgt. Bryan Washko said that the truck was driven "several hundred yards" through the entrance of the J.C. Penney store.  Startled shoppers were injured as the driver was "actively running people over" and a fifth went to the hospital on their own, Sergeant Washko said. Those injured ranged from 6 to 75 years old, he said.  5 DEAD, MANY INJURED AFTER MAN DRIVES INTO GERMAN CHRISTMAS MARKET IN SUSPECTED TERROR ATTACK: REPORT  WATCH:  The incident unfolded as authorities noticed that the suspect, who has not been identified, was seen "driving erratically," and police attempted to pull him over.

Base security found the pair suspicious, and when pressed for identification, the two men, Hasan Y. Hamdan and Mohammad K. Dabous attempted to gain access to the facility. They were stopped and apprehended, shedding light on not just how many times American military bases face infiltration from non-citizens on a weekly basis but whether this was a test run for a terror attack. We'll never know because the case was dismissed (via Potomac Local News):  The cases against two men from Jordan accused of illegally attempting to enter Quantico Marine base have been dismissed.  In earlier court appearances, the Jordanians identified as Hasan Y. Hamdan and Mohammad K. Dabous were released after being charged with misdemeanors stemming from a May 3 incident for attempting to "trespass" on the headquarters of the U.S. Marine Corps, home of the FBI Training Academy and the military's top criminal investigative agencies.  The case garnered national attention, including pleas from Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who demanded answers from President Joe Biden's administration. The duo's identities were finally disclosed at the end of July following exhausted efforts made by congressional leaders in addition to Youngkin.  Prior to the recent dismissal, the Department of Justice accused the pair of "unlawfully go[ing] upon a military installation for a purpose prohibited by law, to wit: knowingly and intentionally entering Marine Corps Base Quantico," according to court documents.  During their July court appearance, Hamdan and Dabous were granted release upon condition to appear for "all future court appearances," including immigration appearances they have "pending." They were ordered "not further trespass on Marine Corps Base Quantico or any other military installation."  We're just letting these guys go, released into the wind for attempting to infiltrate a military installation. Sounds on point for the Biden administration.<br><b>Location:</b> Quantico<br><b>Date:</b> 2024-11-21T03:38:54Z<br><b>Source:</b> Townhall<br></div>`)[0];
